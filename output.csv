== Significant actions ==


=== Against the WTO, 1999 ===
The protest against the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Seattle in 1999 was a signal event in the anti-globalisation movement. Thousands of people gathered to disrupt the World Trade Organisation conference by preventing delegates from entering the conference venue.: p.41  Simultaneously, an online direct protest was run by The Electrohippies Collective with what is now a familiar aspect of cyber space: a denial-of-service (DOS) action. This tactic blocked the computer network servicing the WTO meeting by flooding it with requests. The Ehippies claimed success for the action, saying 450,000 people participated over 5 days, resulting in the WTO conference network being constantly slowed and periodically brought to a halt.
Their claim was disputed by staff of Conxion, the ISP hosting the conference website, who deployed a URL rewriting rule to redirect attack traffic to the attack page itself. It was claimed that this counter-attack ""crashed"" the Ehippies' server within seconds, forcing them to move to another ISP. The majority of hits to the Ehippies' site were thus their own attack page attacking itself. Conxion claimed to have logged fewer than 10,000 unique-source IP addresses. The attack page consisted of nine frames, three attacking the San Jose conference server, three against the Virginia server and three against the main WTO server. The Chicago conference server was not attacked and remained entirely unaffected. However, the WTO main website server, hosted by another provider, did not benefit from the rewrite-engine fix and did suffer significantly from the DOS attack.The Ehippies justified their campaign tactic as enabling tens of thousands of remote computer users to join the Seattle protest action. They pointed out that the action could not have worked without the support of sufficient people—purporting to demonstrate that there was significant support for their action.: p.77 


=== Against the IMF/WB, 2000 ===
As a follow-up to their WTO action, the Ehippies and volunteers tried to shut down the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank websites by a ""virtual sit-in"" in conjunction with 'real world' protests in Washington, D.C. in April 2000. Some 5000 online participants were able to cause only intermittent slowdowns on those sites.: p.25 


=== Response to 'anti-terror' laws ===
The collective was forced to subside temporarily into inaction by the British government's The Terrorism Act 2000 and The Regulation of Investigatory Power Act 2000, perceived as significantly changing the right of British citizens to freely use the internet for political and protest action. Now it ""focusses on the use of technology by activists, mainly through organising workshops and quietly assisting 'behind the scenes' of other campaigns. Current campaigns are the ""Simple"" energy-focused campaign and the ""Browser Alert"" campaign against proprietary software abuses and Digital rights management.

Survival of motor neuron,"['Articles with short description', 'Motor system', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'Spinal muscular atrophy']","Survival of motor neuron or survival motor neuron (SMN) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the SMN1 and SMN2 genes.
SMN is found in the cytoplasm of all animal cells and also in the nuclear gems. It functions in transcriptional regulation, telomerase regeneration and cellular trafficking. SMN deficiency, primarily due to mutations in SMN1, results in widespread splicing defects, especially in spinal motor neurons, and is one cause of spinal muscular atrophy. Research also showed a possible role of SMN in neuronal migration and/or differentiation.","Survival of motor neuron or survival motor neuron (SMN) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the SMN1 and SMN2 genes.

SMN deficiency, primarily due to mutations in SMN1, results in widespread splicing defects, especially in spinal motor neurons, and is one cause of spinal muscular atrophy. Research also showed a possible role of SMN in neuronal migration and/or differentiation.


== Function ==
The SMN protein contains GEMIN2-binding, Tudor and YG-Box domains. It localizes to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Within the nucleus, the protein localizes to subnuclear bodies called gems which are found near coiled bodies containing high concentrations of small ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). This protein forms heteromeric complexes with proteins such as GEMIN2 and GEMIN4, and also interacts with several proteins known to be involved in the biogenesis of snRNPs, such as hnRNP U protein and the small nucleolar RNA binding protein.


== SMN complex ==
SMN complex refers to the entire multi-protein complex involved in the assembly of snRNPs, the essential components of spliceosomal machinery. The complex, apart from the ""proper"" survival of motor neuron protein, includes at least six other proteins (gem-associated protein 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.


== Interactions ==
SMN has been shown to interact with:


== Evolutionary conservation ==
SMN is evolutionarily conserved including the Fungi kingdom, though only fungal organisms with a great number of introns have the Smn gene (or the splicing factor spf30 paralogue). Surprisingly, these are filamentous fungus which have mycelia, so suggesting analogy to the neuronal axons.

In 2017, The band started a kids worship series titled Big Big Worship and have relocated back to New Zealand as of August 2018.


== History ==
The Lads are a New Zealand band that has been active since the late 1990s. The band has played at many church services, youth events, camps and high schools around Australia and New Zealand. Before moving to America, The Lads were a popular act at Parachute Music Festival and performed at each festival, except for 2006, up until 2007. In August 2010, The Lads confirmed via Facebook that they would return to New Zealand for Parachute 2011. It would be their first New Zealand concert in four years. In addition to live tours across the United States, the Lads also produce a TV show which is shown on TV stations around the world.
 The show uses the band's humour to teach kids about certain principles, and episodes are based around action taking place in the band's HQ and their hangout, Murray's Milk Bar. At the end of each show, Murray offers a monologue about that week's episode, followed by a live performance by the band.
The founding members of The Lads are: Mark Millard (vocals/trombone/saxophone/drums), Steve King (drums/vocals), Chris White (keyboards/trumpet/vocals), Bennett ""Ben"" Knowles (bass/vocals) and Paul Cotton (guitar/vocals). The founding members were friends as children, growing up together at the same church – Wellington South Salvation Army – in Wellington, New Zealand. All of the founding members except Paul were born and raised in New Zealand. Paul was born in Canada but moved with his family to New Zealand at the age of 12. As such, he speaks with a Canadian accent. He is also the older brother of TrueBliss singer Joe Cotton.
The band members started out writing songs for fun and became known as ""Lads."" This quickly changed with the success of their second album, Arbor Day. The Lads had a string of number one hits on Christian radio in Australia and New Zealand, and were invited to headline all of the major Christian festivals throughout New Zealand and Australia. During these early performances, the band had no dedicated lead vocalist. Instead, all members except Paul shared the job. Mark became the primary lead vocalist by the time Lost @ Sea was released. Chris and Ben covered lead vocals occasionally. Most notably, Ben sings the song ""Understand"" from the Lost @ Sea album – a song which gained huge radio airplay in New Zealand and was later featured on TV show Dawson's Creek. The song ""Alone"" was also featured.In 1998, The Lads' album Lost @ Sea was named best gospel album at the New Zealand music awards, and their 2001 album Marvel followed suit, taking the prize again.Before the band recorded the album Marvel in 2001, Paul Cotton left the group to pursue a teaching career. He did, however, have some input on the writing of some of the songs on that album. Rimu Tahu from the band Royal Rumble temporarily filled in as live guitarist, but Paul's permanent replacement was Matt Chapman, who only appeared on the album Marvel and later developed RSI and was replaced by Bjorn Bennett in late 2003.
After the band's self-titled sixth album, The Lads their focus began to shift towards a younger age group. Their aim, after a few trips to the US to tour, was to try and break into a larger market by moving to the U.S. in 2005. It was during this time that Chris and Bennett decided to leave the band and move back to New Zealand. Chris later became a Campus pastor for Arise Church. Bjorn's older brother Kristian filled in on bass for early performances after the move to the U.S. but has not been formally replaced since his departure. Instead, the band uses loops and backtracks to fill in instruments vacated by former members. Kristian now plays in a new version of Royal Rumble along with Rimu Tahu. Chris continues to have some creative and lyrical input into the band and can be seen on live footage filmed in New Zealand from the ""Live at The Thunderdome"" DVD. Paul has also had guest slots during performances in the band's home city of Wellington, New Zealand during tours in New Zealand.
Bjorn left the band in 2010 to pursue music with his wife Tara but can still be seen in cartoon form on promotional material and on videos displayed during live shows. He was replaced by Tim Smith. Tim can be seen on the ""Live at Thunderdome"" DVD and on Season 2 of ""The Lads"" TV show but has since left the band and returned to New Zealand. To date, he has not been formally replaced.
In 2017, Mark and Steve started a kids worship series titled Big Big Worship. As of November 2018, the series consists of three volumes, featuring songs by The Lads and three other artists: Cool Worship Kids, Hannah O, and Robotz Worship.In 2018, after over a decade being based in Nashville, the band relocated back to New Zealand


== Christianity ==
The Lads are a band made up of Christians, writing both songs of praise and worship as well as contemporary music.


== Current Band Status ==
In August 2018, Mark and Steve moved back to their homeland of New Zealand after 13 years of living in the United States. They will still be creating new Big Big Worship and Lads material.

He composed symphonies and song cycles on poems by Friedrich Hölderlin, Joseph von Eichendorff, Georg Trakl and Peter Härtling, among others.


== Early life ==
Wilhelm Killmayer was born on 21 August 1927 in Munich, Germany. He studied conducting and composition from 1945 to 1951 in Munich at Hermann Wolfgang von Waltershausen’s Musikseminar. At the same time, he was enrolled at the Munich University where he studied musicology with Rudolf von Ficker and Walter Riezler, and German studies. He was a private student of Carl Orff from 1951 and was admitted to his master class at the Staatliche Musikhochschule in 1953. He was a scholar at the Villa Massimo twice, in 1958 and 1965/66.


== Career ==
Killmayer was a teacher of music theory and counterpoint at the Trappsches Konservatorium in Munich from 1955. He was a conductor of the Bavarian State Opera's ballet from 1961 to 1964. From 1973 to 1992 he was a professor of composition at the Hochschule für Musik. Among his students were Ali N. Askin, Max Beckschäfer, Sandeep Bhagwati, Moritz Eggert, Lutz Landwehr von Pragenau, Fredrik Schwenk, Rudi Spring and Laurence Traiger.

Killmayer's first composition receiving attention was Lorca-Romanzen after Federico García Lorca, premiered at the Donaueschingen Festival. In 1954 he composed a Missa brevis, which was recorded and reviewed:Young (29) Munich-born Composer Wilhelm Killmayer's Missa Brevis ripples with exciting, shifting rhythms and rises skillfully to a colorful series of blasting choral climaxes occasionally more reminiscent of the bandstand than the choir.
Killmayer composed three symphonies called Fogli (1968), Ricordanze (1968/69) and Menschen-Los (1972/73, revised 1988). He composed other orchestral works such as Nachtgedanken (1973), and music for chamber orchestra, The woods so wilde (1970), Schumann in Endenich (1972) and Kindertage (1973). His stage works La Buffonata  (1959/60) and Yolimba (new version 1970) are based on texts by Tankred Dorst. For the 20th anniversary of the Münchener Kammerorchester Killmayer composed in 1970 Fin al punto for string orchestra, which premiered in 1971, conducted by Hans Stadlmair. He wrote about this work:The calm already contains the catastrophe. Out of the calm grows the movement that drives itself to the furthest extreme of its powers, where it collapses. It is the point at which one gives up, beyond which one can escape into the open.
Interested in poetry and the voice, he composed Lieder, three cycles of Hölderlin-Lieder based on poems by Friedrich Hölderlin (1980s), also song cycles based on Joseph von Eichendorff (1991), Georg Trakl (1993 and 1996) and Peter Härtling (1993), and ballads such as Heinrich Heine's Ali Bey (2006) and Eduard Mörike's Der Feuerreiter (2007). Killmayer composed more than 200 Lieder. Killmayer died in Starnberg.


== Awards ==
Killmayer received the Fromm Music Foundation Award in 1954 for his Missa brevis. He was a member of the Bayerische Akademie der Schönen Künste from 1972, and from 1980 a member of the Academy of Arts, Berlin. In 1990 he was the first recipient of the Hindemith Prize of the Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival. Invited by Walter Fink, he was the fourth composer featured in the annual Komponistenporträt of the Rheingau Musik Festival in 1994. In 2003 he was awarded the Musikpreis der Landeshauptstadt München. In 2010 he received the Prize of the Christoph and Stephan Kaske Foundation.

It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.


== History ==


=== Church ===
The present St. Stephen's Anglican Church is the second church by that name in Newtown, both of which were designed by noted church architect, Edmund Blacket. A call for tenders for the construction of 'a small brick church at O'Connell Town', the original St. Stephen's Church, was placed in the Sydney Morning Herald, Saturday 23 November 1844. H. Knight was awarded the contract to build the church, and a Mr. Brander was the carpenter. The foundation stone was laid, on Thursday 26 December 1844, by the Right Reverend Dr. William Broughton, first Bishop of Australia, who also preached. The Reverend Dr. T. Steele, Rector of St. Peter's Cook's River, assisted in the ceremony that was attended by a large crowd composed principally of residents from the immediate neighbourhood. The church was situated on the ""New Town Road"", near Victoria Street, on land donated by representatives of former Governor William Bligh's widow, Elizabeth.The building was completed in nine months, at a cost of £417, and was consecrated on Tuesday 9 September 1845, by Bishop Broughton, at a service conducted by Dr. Steele, before a church ""crowded to excess"" with clergy, dignitaries, including Lady Gipps, wife of the Governor of New South Wales, Sir Maurice O'Connell, Lieutenant Governor of New South Wales, and his wife, Mary, a daughter of Governor Bligh, the Mayor, members of the Newtown Odd Fellows Lodge, and parishioners. The newspaper account described the church as a ""very neat brick edifice, seventy feet long by twenty-six wide"" with a vestry and belfry. The exterior was rather plain, the main feature being large rectangular windows, and the vestry/porch in the center of the building's three bays. The interior was ""very neatly fitted up, all the pews being open"". The roof, likewise, was open. Both open bench pews and open roof were recent innovations in the colony, as was the seating arrangement for the choir, in stalls facing one another, in the chancel.With the growth of population in Newtown in the 1860s it became clear that the small church had become inadequate. It had been designed so that it could be easily enlarged if necessary. This course of action, however, was rejected in favour of erecting a new church on a new site in Camperdown Cemetery. When finally replaced, the original church remained in use as the parish hall and Sunday School, until destroyed by fire on 16 September 1938.In order to build on the newly chosen site, an act of the Parliament of New South Wales was required. A petition from the parish, signed by Christopher Rolleston, William Sedgwick, William Crane, T.C. Breillat and S. C. Brown, requested an act to enable the Bishop of Sydney to convey land to trustees of the church for the erection of a church and parsonage in the Cemetery grounds. Upon presentation by Charles Windeyer, member for West Sydney, the New South Wales Legislative Assembly voted, 10 February 1871, to receive the petition and proceed with an Act. The Act, entitled The Camperdown Cemetery Trust Bill, moved through both houses of parliament quickly and by late March it had received the Governor's consent. Copies were printed by the Government Printing Office and available at 6d apiece. The Government Gazette, 31 March 1871, provided official notice of the Act.Edmund Blacket had been appointed architect on 17 February 1871 and by June had submitted plans and called for tenders for the first part of the building. Blacket agreed to provide supervision of the construction. The contract for the first stage of the stonework (walls to the height of 17 feet) was awarded to Robert Kirkham and his partner, George Dowling. The foundation stone was laid by the Governor, Somerset Lowry-Corry, 4th Earl Belmore, on 11 November 1871. The rector, the Reverend Robert Taylor conducted the first part of the service assisted by other clergy, and the Dean of Sydney preached. A scroll was read by C. Rolleston, and deposited in the cavity of the stone in a sealed bottle, which also contained copies of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Australian Churchman. The scroll was as follows: - ""Newtown:  To the glory of God, and in remembrance of the Christian Martyr St. Stephen, the foundation-stone of this Church was laid by his Excellency the Right Honorable Somerset Richard, Earl of Belmore, Governor-in-Chief of the colony of New South Wales, on the eleventh day of November, in the year of our Lord, 1871, being the thirty-fifth year in the reign of her Majesty Victoria, Queen of Great Britain and Ireland, &c.;, &c.;, &c.;  The Right Reverend F. Barker, D.D., Bishop of Sydney and Metropolitan.  Incumbent - The Rev. Robert Taylor, of Moore College, Liverpool, N.S.W.   Trustees of Cemetery - Messrs. T.C. Breillat, S.C. Brown, W. Crane, sen., C. Rolleston, and Dr. Sedgwick.  Church-wardens - Messrs C. Rolleston, Dr. Sedgwick, and W. Crane, sen.  Church Building Committee - The Revs. R. Taylor and W. Scott, M.A.; and Messrs. M. Albery, M. R. Allan, R. N. Banks, D. Bedford, T.C. Breillat, S.C. Brown, Hon C. Campbell, Hon. J. Campbell, H. Chisholm, W. Crane, sen., W. Crane, jun., W. Curtis, G. Davison, Captain Evans, R. Fowler, F.T. Humphery, W.J. Jordan, M. Metcalfe, R.C. Murray, R.J. Rawsthorne, C. Rolleston, G. Rossitter, C. Sampson, Dr. Sedgwick, H.R. Smith, H.E. Vaughan, H. Vickers, and W. Wilson.  Honorary Treasurers - Messrs. T.C. Breillat and S.C. Brown.  Honorary Secretaries - Rev. R. Taylor and Mr. M.R. Allan.   Architect E.T. Blacket, Esq.  Builders - Messrs. G. Dowling and R. Kirkham.""It was announced that the church when completed would cost £8000, and £6000 would be needed to complete the edifice so that it could be used for divine service. £3000 had already been subscribed by the inhabitants of Newtown, and about £900 by the friends of those who had been buried in Camperdown Cemetery.The building progressed quickly and by September 1873 tenders were called for the second stage of the stonework and completion of the walls of the church, clerestory, tower and steeple. Robert Kirkham was awarded the contract for the second stage. Others involved in the construction of the church were William Curtis, roofing, W. E. Elphinstone, carpentry, and W. Watson, sittings. St. Stephen's was completed in 1874, and a meeting of the subscribers to the building fund was held on Saturday 28 March to allot and let the pews. The first service of worship held on 5 April 1874, Easter Sunday, and an official opening on 9 April. The tower and spire were completed in 1876.St. Stephen's is an English Decorated Gothic Revival church in cruciform plan with side aisles, gallery, two vestries, and porch. The building is dominated, on the north side, by the fine 43-metre (140 ft) high stone tower and spire, which can be seen for miles. The walls of the church are sandstone, quarried from the nearby Pyrmont stone quarries. The exterior ornamentation, apart from the stone traced windows is restrained. Interior columns are of Melbourne bluestone and the roof is slate. With dimensions of 34 by 15 metres (110 by 48 ft), and a final construction cost of A£13,000, it was the largest and most prominent building in the area, and was widely recognized as one of Edmund Blacket's finest designs. The full amount for the cost of the building was subscribed at one time making it possible to erect it in a continuous operation without stops and starts unlike so many other churches Blacket designed. Eminent architectural historian Morton Herman calls the design of St. Stephen's, ""a magnificent success - It is a church designed to be seen all round from every angle, and from every angle it is eminently satisfactory"". In another of his books, Herman designates St. Stephen's as ""one of the finest Gothic Revival buildings in Sydney."" Joan Kerr describes the church as 'one of [Blacket's] most successful buildings', Blacket having, by 1870 ""completely mastered his Decorated Gothic repertoire"" and [being] more confident in composition and less fussy in detailing than in some of his earlier designs.' The tower and spire, she notes, are one of Blacket's finest compositions.The two-manual pipe organ was built by the London firm, J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd, in 1874, at the cost of £800. Blacket designed the organ case, sending specification to Walker and Son. He also was instrumental in having the organ placed in the south transept rather than in the west gallery. The bells, a set of twelve hemispherical bells, new type of bell, manipulated by a keyboard, were ordered by Blacket from the well known foundry of Messrs. Mears and Stainbank, Whitechapel, in the East End of London. Prior to installation in St. Stephen's tower, they were exhibited in the great Sydney International Exhibition of 1879–80.Other than some minor alterations to the organ in 1895 by G.K. Sandford of Newtown, and a redesigning of the chancel by prominent Sydney architect, Burcham Clamp, in 1927 and carried out by J. M and A. Pringle, the church remains as Blacket designed it.


=== Rectory ===
The adjoining Rectory was built in 1910. The Sexton's Cottage was built in 1848 and the huge Moreton Bay Fig Tree (Ficus macrophylla) to its immediate south-west and some of the European oak trees (Quercus robur) in the cemetery also date from this time.


=== Cemetery ===

The Camperdown Cemetery was established in 1848 on about 13 acres of the 240 acres granted to Governor Bligh, known as the Camperdown Estate. This was the first privately owned and operated Anglican cemetery in Sydney. It was the main cemetery for Sydney from 1849 to 1867. During this time it received over 15,000 interments and was the subject of a state government select committee inquiry. This inquiry was convened to address the mismanagement of a number of cemeteries within Sydney and it found that the accusations directed at the Camperdown Cemetery were founded. Sale of plots was terminated in 1867 and it closed in 1868 but a trickle of burials continued until c. 1920s-1940s (sources conflict on the end date), these being within family and pre-purchased plots and crypts).Following its closure, the cemetery fell into disrepair. It was reduced in size in the 1950s when Camperdown Memorial Rest Park was established, comprising two distinct sections: the St. Stephens Church and graveyard (within a six foot high sandstone wall) and the Camperdown Memorial Rest Park (without the wall), treated as broadly grassed open space with pockets of tree planting, and, directly south of the graveyard wall, a children's play ground area. The Church and graveyard have been managed since the 1970s by the Camperdown Cemetery Trust and the Camperdown Memorial Rest Park is managed by Marrickville Council.


== Description ==
St Stephens Church of England is an English Decorated Gothic Revival church in cruciform plan with side aisles, gallery, two vestries, porch and tower with a stone spire on the north side. It is built from Pyrmont stone with a slate roof and stone traceried windows. Externally the church is well massed, the whole being dominated by a fine stone tower and spire. The ornament of the exterior is restrained.
OrganThe fine Walker organ with 1,100 pipes and tracker action was made in England in 1874.
CarillonThe peal of 20 domes was made in England by the Whitechapel foundry and was installed in the church in 1880 after being used in the Great Exhibition in the Botanic Gardens in 1879.The site also contains the rectory and sexton's cottage.


== Heritage listing ==
This building is one of Australia's best Gothic Revival churches on this scale and its unique and historic surroundings render it a building of the highest importance. The church is in a prominent position on the crest of a rise, approximately three miles south west of the city of Sydney. The spire is notable for miles. The cemetery forms a unique close to the Church; it contains numerous fine trees including a large Moreton Fig Tree.St Stephen's Anglican Church was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

== History ==
The constituency was created for the 1997 general election from parts of several former Hertfordshire seats. Prior to 1997, Hitchin was included in the abolished North Hertfordshire constituency and Harpenden in the St Albans constituency, while the village of Wheathampstead was part of the Welwyn Hatfield constituency.
The seat's first MP was Peter Lilley, a former Secretary of State for various government departments in the Major ministry in the 1990s, who had previously represented St Albans from 1983 to 1997. He announced he would not contest the seat at the 2017 general election. He was succeeded in 2017 by Bim Afolami of the Conservatives, who retained it at the 2019 general election albeit with a reduced majority.

== History ==


=== Origins ===
After leaving Dear and the Headlights in 2007, Gospel Claws lead-singer and guitarist Joel Marquard returned to his job as a delivery-man for FedEx. His attachment to music, however, could not keep him out of the scene.  That same year, he began collaborating with his friend Sloan Walters, drawing from the catalog of music that he had written over time outside of Dear and the Headlights. These two songwriters eventually recruited John Mulhern and Scott Hall to fill out the rhythm section. Ironically, it was Marquard's day job for FedEx that led him to make the connections necessary to solidify the band's line-up. One day, he found that he had a delivery for Wesley Hilsabeck, a talented guitarist that he had met in the past. Recognizing the name on the package, but not finding him at home, Marquard left a message which eventually led to Hilsabeck joining the band.The band's choice of name has been a consistent subject of discussion.  Although the band bears the name Gospel Claws, and its members originally connected through church experiences, Gospel Claws is not a Christian band. The band has also had to deal with the constant misspelling of its name, as writers and promoters have listed them as Gospel Clause instead of Gospel Claws.  The band's first full-length album's name, C-L-A-W-S, stemmed from that issue.  Band members have stated that they sometimes regret their original choice of name, and have considered changing it.


=== First EP and C-L-A-W-S ===
Gospel Claws released its first studio recording in 2009. This self-titled EP would create some early buzz for the band. Brandon Nolta at Boise Weekly enjoyed the record's ""new-retro vibe"" and said that it was ""well worth your currency, no matter how inscrutable [the band's] name.""The band would continue to pick up momentum with its first full-length album, C-L-A-W-S, released in October 2010.  This album was recorded almost entirely live by Bob Hoag at Flying Blanket Recording,  and was very positively received. One critic raved that, ""combining indie rock, folk and a bit of soul to produce their own distinctive sound,"" Gospel Claws' ""musical ingenuity separates them from the crowd."" Kate Bracaglia at Phrequency.com said the record ""is full of the type of slosh-y summer anthems that make you feel alive—from the pounding beat and stylish, [ Clap Your Hands Say Yeah ]-style guitars of opener 'Walk me down' to the sing-song-y, campfire feel of 'Summer nights lakeside.'"" The positive album reviews attracted some significant national attention and translated into some commercial success.  C-L-A-W-S spent 5 weeks in the top 100 on CMJ Top 200 and 4 weeks on the FMQB Submodern charts with the album peaking at No. 2 and the single ""Walk me Down"" at No. 6. After C-L-A-W-S, Paste Magazine named Gospel Claws the top Arizona-band ""you should listen to now."" This record was also featured on NPR's program All Songs Considered.Their expanding success allowed Gospel Claws to open for such acts as Wild Nothing, Cotton Jones, No Age, Plants and Animals, and Portugal. The Man. In March 2011, they showcased at SXSW.


=== Put Your Sunshine Away LP ===
For Gospel Claws' second LP, small indie-label Common Wall Media could only agree to provide a little more than half of the record's funding. This meant that the band had to come up with at least $3,000. To reach their goal, the band agreed to use money earned at shows, and to set up a Kickstarter to solicit funds. In the end, the band collected $4,520, or 113% of its original Kickstarter goal, and will use the funds to record their album with Bob Hoag at Flying Blanket Recording.
Their successes, unfortunately, also came with some significant challenges.  First, after recording almost half of the album, Wesley Hilsabeck had to leave the band. The band was able to replace him, but they will miss his contributions.
Then, even more serious, lead-singer and guitarist Joel Marquard was diagnosed with testicular cancer.  Fortunately, the cancer was caught in its early stages and, after treatment, Marquard has been declared ""cancer free.""   The cancer diagnosis did nothing to slow the band down.  They started recording their sophomore album while Marquard was undergoing treatment and it is still due for release in the fall 2012.  While the new album's stated influences — '50s doo-wop, Sam Cooke, and the Beach Boys — do not point to an aggressive sound, Marquard has stated that it should not be much mellower than the group's 2010 debut C-L-A-W-S. In jest, the band has also stated that ""The running joke at the moment is if Gospel Claws' new record (due out this fall) sounds a little less ballsy than the first, at least there's a valid explanation for it. 'Most bands' sophomore records are kind of mellower than the first, but usually not for medical reasons.'""Finally, in another tragedy for the band, guitarist Mark Erickson died in August 2012.

Disciples of Christ (Campbell Movement),"['Christian terminology', 'Nondenominational Christianity', 'Restoration Movement']","The Disciples of Christ (Campbell Movement) were a group arising during the Second Great Awakening of the early 19th century.  The most prominent leaders were Thomas and Alexander Campbell.  The group was committed to restoring primitive Christianity.  It merged with the Christians (Stone Movement) in 1832 to form what is now described as the American Restoration Movement (also known as the Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement).

It merged with the Christians (Stone Movement) in 1832 to form what is now described as the American Restoration Movement (also known as the Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement).


== History ==
The Campbell wing of the American Restoration Movement was launched when Thomas Campbell published the Declaration and Address of the Christian Association of Washington in 1809. The Presbyterian Synod had suspended his ministerial credentials. In The Declaration and Address he set forth some of his convictions about the church of Jesus Christ, as he organized the Christian Association of Washington, in Washington County, Pennsylvania, not as a church but as an association of persons seeking to grow in faith.: 108–111  On May 4, 1811, the Christian Association constituted itself as a congregationally governed church. With the building it constructed at Brush Run, Pennsylvania, it became known as Brush Run Church.: 117  When their study of the New Testament led the reformers to begin to practice baptism by immersion, the nearby Redstone Baptist Association invited Brush Run Church to join with them for the purpose of fellowship. The reformers agreed, provided that they would be ""allowed to preach and to teach whatever they learned from the Scriptures."": 86 
Thomas' son Alexander immigrated to the US to join him in 1809, and before long assumed the leading role in the movement.: 106 The Campbells worked within the Redstone Baptist Association during the period 1815 through 1824. While both the Campbells and the Baptists shared practices of baptism by immersion and congregational polity, it was soon clear that he and his associates were not traditional Baptists. Within the Redstone Association, some of the Baptist leaders considered the differences intolerable when Alexander Campbell began publishing a journal, The Christian Baptist, which promoted reform. Campbell anticipated the conflict and moved his membership to a congregation of the Mahoning Baptist Association in 1824.: 131 Alexander used The Christian Baptist to address what he saw as the key issue of reconstructing the apostolic Christian community in a systematic and rational manner.: 106  He wanted to clearly distinguish between essential and non-essential aspects of primitive Christianity.: 106  Among what he identified as essential were ""congregational autonomy, a plurality of elders in each congregation, weekly communion and immersion for the remission of sins."": 106  Among practices he rejected as non-essential were ""the holy kiss, deaconesses, communal living, footwashing and charismatic exercises."": 106 

In 1827, the Mahoning Association appointed Walter Scott as an evangelist. Through Scott's efforts, the Mahoning Association grew rapidly. In 1828, Thomas Campbell visited several of the congregations formed by Scott and heard him preach. Campbell believed that Scott was bringing an important new dimension to the movement with his approach to evangelism.: 132–133 Several Baptist associations began disassociating congregations that refused to subscribe to the Philadelphia Confession. The Mahoning Association came under attack. In 1830, The Mahoning Baptist Association disbanded. The younger Campbell ceased publication of the Christian Baptist. In January 1831, he began publication of the Millennial Harbinger.: 144–145 


== Influence of the Enlightenment ==

The Age of Enlightenment had a significant influence on the Campbell movement.: 80–86  Thomas Campbell was a student of the Enlightenment philosopher John Locke.: 82  While he did not explicitly use the term ""essentials,"" in the Declaration and Address, Campbell proposed the same solution to religious division as had been advanced earlier by Herbert and Locke: ""[R]educe religion to a set of essentials upon which all reasonable persons might agree."": 80  The essentials he identified were those practices for which the Bible provided ""a 'Thus saith the Lord,' either in express terms or by approved precedent."": 81  Unlike Locke, who saw the earlier efforts by Puritans as inherently divisive, Campbell argued for ""a complete restoration of apostolic Christianity."": 82  Thomas believed that creeds served to divide Christians. He also believed that the Bible was clear enough that anyone could understand it and, thus, creeds were unnecessary.: 114 Alexander Campbell was also deeply influenced by Enlightenment thinking, in particular the Scottish School of Common Sense of Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart.: 84  This group saw the Bible as providing concrete facts rather than abstract truths, and advocated a scientific or Baconian approach to interpreting the Bible that would begin with those facts, arrange the ones applicable to a given topic, and then use them to draw conclusions.: 84  Alexander Campbell reflected this approach, when arguing that ""the Bible is a book of facts, not of opinions, theories, abstract generalities, nor of verbal definitions."": 84  He believed that if Christians would limit themselves to the facts found in the Bible, they would necessarily come to agreement. He saw those facts as providing a blueprint or constitution for the church.: 84, 85 


== Characteristics of the movement ==
Thomas Campbell combined the Enlightenment approach to unity with the Reformed and Puritan traditions of restoration.: 82, 106  The Enlightenment affected the Campbell movement in two ways. First, it provided the idea that Christian unity could be achieved by finding a set of essentials that all reasonable people could agree on. The second was the concept of a rational faith that was formulated and defended on the basis of a set of facts derived from the Bible.: 85, 86 Alexander Campbell's millennialism was more optimistic than Stone's.: 6  He had more confidence in the potential for human progress and believed that Christians could unite to transform the world and initiate a millennial age.: 6  Campbell's conceptions were postmillennial, as he anticipated that the progress of the church and society would lead to an age of peace and righteousness before the return of Christ.: 6  This optimistic approach meant that, in addition to his commitment to primitivism, he had a progressive strand in his thinking.: 7 Those following the Campbells were called ""Reforming Baptists"" because of the associations with the Baptist at the beginning of the movement; this was sometimes shortened to ""Reformers."": 85   ""Disciples"" was the name Alexander Campbell preferred.: 86   Opponents of the movement nicknamed them ""Campbellites."": 85–86 


== Merger with the Christians (Stone Movement) ==

The Campbell movement was characterized by a ""systematic and rational reconstruction"" of the early church, in contrast to the Stone movement which was characterized by radical freedom and lack of dogma.: 106–108  Despite their differences, the two movements agreed on several critical issues.: 108  Both saw restoring apostolic Christianity as a means of hastening the millennium.: 108  Both also saw restoring the early church as a route to Christian freedom.: 108  And, both believed that unity among Christians could be achieved by using apostolic Christianity as a model.: 108  The commitment of both movements to restoring the early church and to uniting Christians was enough to motivate a union between many in the two movements.: 8, 9 The Stone and Campbell movements merged in 1832.: 116–120 : 28 : 212 : xxi : xxxvii  This was formalized at the High Street Meeting House in Lexington, Kentucky with a handshake between Barton W. Stone and ""Raccoon"" John Smith.: 116–120  Smith had been chosen, by those present, to speak in behalf of the followers of the Campbells.: 116  A preliminary meeting of the two groups was held in late December 1831, culminating with the merger on January 1, 1832.: 116–120 : xxxvii Two representatives of those assembled were appointed to carry the news of the union to all the churches: John Rogers, for the Christians and ""Raccoon"" John Smith for the reformers. Despite some challenges, the merger succeeded.: 153–154  Many believed the union held great promise for the future success of the combined movement, and greeted the news enthusiastically.: 9 With the merger, there was the challenge of what to call the new movement. Clearly, finding a Biblical, non-sectarian name was important. Stone wanted to continue to use the name ""Christians."" Alexander Campbell insisted upon ""Disciples of Christ"". As a result, both names were used.: 27–28 : 125  The confusion over names has been present ever since.: 27–28

In 1989, the British Hong Kong Government announced that the Airport Core Programme, which includes the north through the Tai Ho, North Lantau Highway, and the development of Tai Ho into new towns. The plans for the Tung Chung line was released at this time which also called for the construction of a Tai Ho station. However, in the late 1990s, due to the slow down in the development of Tung Chung, the expected slow down in population growth, coupled with environmental concerns that the development of Tai Ho will affect the local environment and ecology, large-scale construction is still under review.

Villages in the area include Tai Ho Village (大蠔村), Tai Ho New Village (大蠔新村) and Ngau Kwu Long (牛牯塱).


== Tai Ho Stream ==
Tai Ho Stream contains the largest varieties of freshwaterfish species in Hong Kong, with 47 species of fish. In 1999, the Hong Kong Government designated Tai Ho Stream as the 63rd Site of Special Scientific Interest due to the discovery of the Ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis) in the river, which cannot be found anywhere in the world except for waters in Hokkaidō, and Hong Kong.

Arnoldia (journal),"['Articles with short description', 'Botany journals', 'CS1: long volume value', 'Quarterly journals (infobox)', 'Short description is different from Wikidata']","Arnoldia is a quarterly magazine published by the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University. It is an interdisciplinary publication with articles covering a broad range of topics including plant exploration, plant taxonomy and biogeography, landscape design, and more. While the authors are primarily researchers and other plant professionals, all are encouraged to write with a narrative and explanatory style that is accessible to a wide range of readers.

While the authors are primarily researchers and other plant professionals, all are encouraged to write with a narrative and explanatory style that is accessible to a wide range of readers.


== History ==
Arnoldia was established as the Bulletin of Popular Information in 1911. The Arnold Arboretum's first director, Charles Sprague Sargent, viewed the publication as a means of alerting visitors to the ""flowering of important plants"" in the Arnold Arboretum's collections. Initially, the Bulletins were issued only during the growing season, and with a Bulletin in hand, there was no reason a visitor should miss the flowering or fruiting of any plant on the grounds.After Sargent's death in March 1927, Ernest Henry Wilson assumed responsibility of the publication. Other than the addition of illustrations, however, the publication continued to be a seasonal guide filled with information on the phenology, history, and culture of the Arboretum's plants. It was not until Wilson's untimely death in 1930 that the content began to expand. Edgar Anderson, best known for his later work at the Missouri Botanical Garden, edited the publication for the next four years, and while ""plants of current interest"" remained a regular feature, staff members began to contribute longer articles, with new interdisciplinary topics including ethnobotanical uses of plants, botanical art, and landscape history. This thematic expansion was encouraged by Oakes Ames, a Harvard professor of botany who had been appointed the managing supervisor of the Arnold Arboretum in 1927. In 1931, Ames wrote the first Bulletin article about botanical art.Donald Wyman took over the editorship in 1936, and in 1941 Arnold Arboretum director Elmer Drew Merrill, who was partial to one-word titles, changed the Bulletin of Popular Information into Arnoldia, honoring benefactor James Arnold. Wyman wrote the lion's share of its articles for over thirty years. A remembrance in 1993 recognized his contributions: ""More, perhaps, than any other single person, certainly of his era, he advanced the knowledge of hardy woody plants through his articles published in Arnoldia and elsewhere . . . His work may now seem familiar, but only because it's been so often imitated.""After Wyman's retirement, other editors expanded the content. In 1970, Arnoldia was reformatted as magazine with multiple contributors per issue, and the inaugural issue contained articles about botanical libraries, a botanical trip to Hong Kong, and the natural history of a common weed.  The scope of the publication has continued to expand over the subsequent decades, attracting an even wider variety of scholarship.


== Aims and scope ==
Arnoldia calls its interdisciplinary approach “plant studies,” as opposed to “plant science,” which implies that authors should use a humanities-based approach, even when the subject matter comes from a scientific research background.

== Report ==
Qualifying threw up a few surprises, as the Bridgestone tyres used by several smaller teams proved strong, but it was ultimately Jacques Villeneuve who won. Mika Häkkinen had been leading Villeneuve after the start but his engine failed yet again, before he even managed to complete the first lap. Jarno Trulli lead the early laps as a result, and was running 2nd (though still needing to make another pitstop) when his engine also failed and left oil out the track, which caused Rubens Barrichello to spin out of the race in the closing laps as a result.
A spectacular collision occurred between Eddie Irvine and Jean Alesi. As they battled for 4th place on lap 37, Alesi tried to outbrake Irvine into the chicane from approximately eight car-lengths behind, and as Irvine took evasive action, the Frenchman drove into the Northern Irishman's car at such speed that Alesi's car went over the top of Irvine's while the latter was pitched into a spin. Alesi was placed under investigation by the stewards for dangerous driving after the race, although no charges were formally brought against either driver.
Michael Schumacher ran as high as 3rd, but received a stop-go penalty for overtaking Heinz-Harald Frentzen under yellow flags. Schumacher claimed he had not seen them, and that they were not visible on the inside of the corner.Austrian Formula One veteran Gerhard Berger announced he was to retire at the end of the season, shortly after he qualified 18th on the grid.

Beginning in 1938, CCC accomplished many projects within the park, but most of their efforts focused on the headquarters area where they constructed sewer and water lines, roads, and buildings.

It installs, maintains and repairs all the signalling and telecommunications on the LWR. Based primarily at Ludborough, the department looks after the railways two functioning signal boxes at Ludborough and North Thoresby.


== Ludborough ==

The original box was demolished by British Railways in early 1970s, after the line had closed to passengers. The new box was constructed by the LWR between 1994 and 1996, and is a close representation of the original. The 18 lever frame inside the box is the original frame from Hainton street in Grimsby. This box was standing until 1991 when it was destroyed by fire. Also inside Ludborough box is the original gate wheel from Hainton Street which opened the level crossing gates there. Ludborough box was passed by HMRI in October 2004 for use and was officially opened in April 2005.
Out of the 18 levers, at the present time, only 4 are in use. However a future scheme is currently being worked on that will bring 8 levers into use. All the signals with the exception of the Down Starter (LU3) have SPT's (Signal Post Telephones) fitted to them. These allow both the driver and signalman to contact each other. Ludborough currently operates two Great Northern Railway somersault signals (LU3 down starter and LU14 Up Inner Home). These type of signals were used all over the East Lincolnshire Railway, and is appropriate for the railway's needs.
Future plans will see the box operate 3 additional signals and a ground frame release operated from the box.


== North Thoresby ==
North Thoresby signal box is a 7 lever Eastern region ground frame that has been installed to operate the track and signalling layout at North Thoresby. It operates two main line signals, two shunting signal for access to and from the siding, a facing point lock and a facing point for access in and out of the siding. With No.1 lever being released by the annetts key making up the final lever in the frame. North Thoresby signal box was commissioned on 7 August 2009.
The signalling type used here is a mixture of both ex-BR signalling and Ex LNER. All signals are of the Upper quadrant signal variety. This means that when the signals are cleared the move upwards to a 45 degree angle to show all clear. If the wire snaps the signal automatically fails safe and returns to danger.
A track circuit runs over the main line and siding to give an indication to the signalman as to the whereabouts of the train and also to prevent the points from being moved under a train.


== Future ==
The future for the department is a good one. 
With over 8 miles (13 km) of railway to re-build and four level crossings to re-instate, there is a lot of work to carry out. The Lincolnshire Wolds Railway is currently aiming towards Utterby halt (the next adjacent level crossing in the direction of Louth) and is also currently rebuilding the whole layout at the Louth end of the yard. 
This will include extending and altering the engine shed, laying new point work and extending the main line towards Utterby and updating the signalling accordingly. This will include 2 new signals and the ground frame. One of the new signals will be a 3 aspect colour light and the other will be a GNR somersault. When this work is complete the railway will then progress towards Utterby Halt and ultimately Louth.

== Overview ==
The show, starring Eve Arden, is about a widowed mother, Liza Hammond, of twin daughters who earns money from writing books. It features actress Frances Bavier, the future Aunt Bee of The Andy Griffith Show, as Nora, Arden's mother and housekeeper. In eight of the twenty-six episodes, Allyn Joslyn portrays George Howell, her agent and potential boyfriend.
The series was produced for Arden's Westhaven Enterprises by Desilu. The show was filmed with three cameras in front of a live audience, although a laugh track was used for sweetening purposes. The show was based on author Emily Kimbrough's book It Gives Me Great Pleasure.Eve Arden had enjoyed a very successful run on radio in the CBS program Our Miss Brooks from 1948 to 1957. When it premiered as a television series in the fall of 1952, it was very popular with audiences and ran for four years on CBS.  During its final season, the ratings fell and the show was canceled in the spring of 1956. In the fall of 1957, Desilu Studios, which had produced Our Miss Brooks, attempted to resurrect Arden's television career with The Eve Arden Show and CBS scheduled it for Tuesday nights. With this new program, Arden was not able to duplicate the success she had with Our Miss Brooks. Despite the fact that it followed The Phil Silvers Show (which during its first two years had been one of the top 30 programs on television), both sitcoms failed to beat its competition on ABC - Cheyenne (with Sugarfoot on alternate weeks) and The Life and Times Of Wyatt Earp. After the 1957–1958 season, The Phil Silvers Show was renewed for one more year but The Eve Arden Show ended its one-year run after its 26th episode. For the next several years, Arden continued to work on television as a guest star on several programs. Then, in 1967, Desi Arnaz brought her back to weekly television in an NBC sitcom co-starring singer-comedian Kaye Ballard called The Mothers-In-Law. The series was only moderately successful and lasted two years.

Japanese cruiser Suma,"['1895 ships', 'Articles containing Japanese-language text', 'Commons category link is on Wikidata', 'Naval ships of Japan', 'Russo-Japanese War cruisers of Japan', 'Ships built by Yokosuka Naval Arsenal', 'Suma-class cruisers', 'Use dmy dates from November 2020', 'World War I cruisers of Japan']","Suma (須磨) was a protected cruiser of the Imperial Japanese Navy, designed and built by the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal in Japan. She was the lead ship in the  Suma-class cruiser, and her sister ship was Akashi. The name Suma comes from a geographic location near Kobe, in Hyōgo Prefecture.","Suma (須磨) was a protected cruiser of the Imperial Japanese Navy, designed and built by the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal in Japan. She was the lead ship in the  Suma-class cruiser, and her sister ship was Akashi. The name Suma comes from a geographic location near Kobe, in Hyōgo Prefecture.


== Background ==
Suma was designed and built at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, as part of an Imperial Japanese Navy program to end its dependence on foreign powers for modern warships, using an all-Japanese design and all-Japanese materials. Construction took four years, from 1892 to 1896. She was laid down on 6 August 1892, launched on 9 March 1895 and commissioned on 12 December 1896 While more lightly armed and armored than many of the cruiser's contemporaries, her small size and relatively simple design facilitated the vessel's construction and her relatively high speed made the ship useful for many military operations. However, as with most Japanese designs of the period, she proved to be top-heavy and had issues with seaworthiness and stability.


== Design ==
The design for Suma was based on an all-steel, double-bottomed hull, with an armored deck, divided underneath by watertight bulkheads. The armor, of the Harvey armor variety, covered only vital areas, such as the boilers, gun magazines and critical machinery, with a thickness of 25 millimetres (0.98 in) on the deck.
Her main battery consisted of two QF 6 inch /40 naval guns, one set in the forecastle and one in the stern. The main guns had a range of up to 9,100 metres (4.9 nmi) with a nominal firing rate of 5.7 shots/minute. Secondary armament consisted of six QF 4.7-inch guns mounted in sponsons on the upper deck. These guns had a range of up to 9,000 metres (4.9 nmi) with a nominal firing rate of 12 shots/minute. She also had ten QF 3 pounder Hotchkiss guns, with a range of up to 6,000 metres (3.2 nmi) with a nominal firing rate of 20 shots/minute, mounted four on the upper deck, two on the poop, two on the after bridge and one each on the bow and stern, as well as four 1-inch Nordenfelt guns, which were later replaced by four 7.62 mm Maxim machine guns. She also was equipped with two 356 mm (14.0 in) torpedoes, mounted on the deck.Her powerplant consisted of two vertical triple expansion steam engines, with eight cylindrical boilers in two boiler rooms separated by a watertight bulkhead .When completed, the ship was found to have stability problems, and her fighting tops were later removed to lower her center of gravity.


== Service record ==


=== Early career ===

Completed too late for combat operations in the First Sino-Japanese War, the first overseas deployment of Suma was to Manila in the Philippines during the Spanish–American War, where she helped safeguard the interests and citizens of Japan during that conflict.
From June to July 1900, Suma was under the command of Commander Shimamura Hayao, and supported Japanese naval landing forces which occupied the port city of Tianjin in northern China during the Boxer Rebellion, as part of the Japanese contribution to the Eight-Nation Alliance.


=== Russo-Japanese War ===
At the start of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05, Suma was based out of the Takeshiki Guard District on the island of Tsushima from which the ship made patrols of the Korea Strait preventing any linkage between the Russian cruiser squadron based in Vladivostok and the main Russian Pacific Fleet based at Port Arthur.
On 18 February 1904, under the orders of Admiral Itō Sukeyuki, Suma arrived in Shanghai with the cruiser Akitsushima to compel the disarmament of the Russian gunboat Mandzhur, or the ship's destruction under the international norms for neutrality, accomplishing her mission by 31 March.
In early May, Suma covered landings by the Japanese Second Army in Manchuria, following which (on 15 May), she assisted in the rescue of survivors from the crew of the ill-fated battleships Hatsuse and Yashima after those ships struck naval mines off the coast of Port Arthur. She then joined the list of Japanese ships blockading the Russian naval base in the Battle of Port Arthur.
On 7 June, Suma, together with the gunboats Uji, cruiser Akashi and a detachment of destroyers entered the Gulf of Bohai to support the landings of elements of the Japanese Second Army, and later bombarded Russian shore installations and a railway line along the coast of Manchuria.
During the start of the Battle of the Yellow Sea, Suma had a mechanical failure, and was ordered to withdraw to join the 5th Division (consisting of the obsolete Matsushima, Hashidate and Saiyen, located to the north of the line of battle. However, when the Russian squadron unexpected turned back towards Port Arthur, Suma was cut off, but by coincidence was in the path of the fleeing cruisers Askold and Novik. Although exchanging some gunfire, Suma was unable to prevent the escape of the Russian ships. After the battle, Suma returned to the Japanese repair station in the Elliott Islands, and then rejoined the blockade of Port Arthur.
In February 1905, Suma provided escort to transports in the Sea of Japan, especially for the delivery of vitally needed artillery and reinforcements for the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA). During the Battle of Tsushima on 27 May 1905, Suma was flagship of the 6th Division under Rear Admiral Tōgō Masamichi. Together with Chiyoda, she was ordered to shadow the Russian fleet on its approach to the Tsushima Strait. During the first day of the battle, Suma and Chiyoda attacked on the left flank (southern portion) of the Russian formation, capturing transports and the hospital ships Orel and Kostroma. Later that day, Suma and Chiyoda attacked the cruisers Oleg, Aurora, Vladimir Monomakh and Dmitrii Donskoi and sinking the already damaged battleship Knyaz Suvorov and repair ship Kamchatka. During the battle, Suma took only small damage with three crewmen injured. The following day, 28 May, Suma reported the surrender of the remaining ships under the command of Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov, and unsuccessfully pursued the cruiser Zhemchug, which managed to escape the battle.Afterwards, Suma was assigned to the Japanese force which seized Sakhalin from Russia, covering landings by the IJA 13th Division at several locations, and securing lighthouses and port facilities. In August, her reconnaissance parameters were expanded to include the southern coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula and the Commander Islands, and was dispatched to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky to rescue retired Lieutenant Shigetada Gunji, who had been arrested by Russian authorities for his unauthorized private invasion of Kamchatka. While in the area, Suma also captured the United States-flagged steamer Australia, which was found to be transporting war contraband.


=== Later career ===
Suma arrived in Yokohama to participate in a naval review celebrating the Japanese victory on 23 October 1905. She underwent overhaul in 1908, when her cylindrical boilers were replaced with Miyabara water-tube boilers. On 28 August 1912, Suma was downgraded to a 2nd class cruiser.
In 1916, during World War I, Suma was initially based at Manila, and assigned to patrol the sea lanes in the South China Sea and Sulu Sea from Borneo to the Malacca Straits against German commerce raiders and U-boats. She was later based in Singapore together with Yahagi, Niitaka and Tsushima and a flotilla of destroyers, and reassigned to provide coastal defense to Australia and New Zealand, as part of Japan's contribution to the Allied war effort under the Anglo-Japanese Alliance.After the war, Suma was re-designated as a 2nd-class coastal defense vessel from 1 September 1921 . Suma was demilitarized per the Washington Naval Treaty and re-designated a utility vessel on 4 April 1923 and was removed from the active navy list. She continued to be used as a guard ship at Sasebo Naval District until broken up for scrap in 1928.

== History ==
The hospital dates from 1721, when it was founded by philanthropist Thomas Guy, who had made a fortune as a printer of Bibles and greatly increased it by speculating in the South Sea Bubble. It was originally established as a hospital to treat ""incurables"" discharged from St Thomas' Hospital. Guy had been a Governor and benefactor of St Thomas' and his fellow Governors supported his intention by granting the south-side of St Thomas' Street for a peppercorn rent for 999 years. Following his death in 1724, Thomas Guy was entombed at the hospital's chapel (also dating from the 18th century), in a tomb featuring a marble sculpture by John Bacon.The original buildings formed a courtyard facing St Thomas Street, comprising the hall on the east side and the chapel, Matron's House and Surgeon's House on the west-side. A bequest of £180,000 by William Hunt in 1829, one of the largest charitable bequests in England in historic terms, allowed for a further hundred beds to be accommodated. Hunt's name was given to the southern expansion of the hospital buildings which took place in 1850. Two inner quadrangles were divided by a cloister which was later restyled and dedicated to the hospital's members who fell in the First World War. The east side comprised the care wards and the ""counting house"" with the governors' Burfoot Court Room. The north-side quadrangle is dominated by a statue of Lord Nuffield (1877–1963) who was the chairman of governors for many years and also a major benefactor.In 1974, the hospital added the 34-storey Guy's Tower and 29-storey Guy's House: this complex was designed by Watkins Gray. The Wolfson Centre for Age-Related Diseases, which is dedicated to improving outcomes of conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, stroke, Parkinson's disease and spinal cord injury, was opened by the Princess Royal in December 2004.In October 2005 children's departments moved to the Evelina London Children's Hospital in the grounds next to St Thomas's close to the Palace of Westminster. A new cancer centre, designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners, and built by Laing O'Rourke at a cost of £160 million, was completed in April 2016.

		
		
		
		
		


== Facilities ==
Medical services at the Guy's site are now concentrated in the buildings to the east of Great Maze Pond: these buildings, which are connected, are known as Tower Wing, Bermondsey Wing, Southwark Wing and Borough Wing. The Cancer Centre is in a separate building just to the south. To the west of the Great Maze Pond is Guy's Campus which forms part of King's College London.At 148.65 metres (487.7 ft) high, Guy's Tower (now called the Tower Wing) regained its tallest hospital building in the world status in 2014. It has since been surpassed by the Outpatient Center at the Houston Methodist Hospital, in Houston, USA at 156.05 metres (512.0 ft).

Kolpak played 71 national team games for Slovakia. His legal actions in Germany set a precedent for professional sports in Europe, known as the Kolpak ruling, which have had a wide-ranging effect, especially in regards to English county cricket and British professional rugby union.Kolpak played for HT Tatran Prešov, HC Dukla Praha and HK VSŽ Košice before moving to TSV Baden Östringen in the German 2nd Bundesliga in 1997. He played for the club and its successor SG Kronau/Östringen (now Rhein-Neckar Löwen) for ten seasons, though he missed most of the 2002–03 and 2003–04 seasons due to a torn anterior cruciate ligament.

In 2012, Luc Hoffmann's MAVA Foundation, along with WWF International, established the Luc Hoffmann Institute. He was the author of more than 60 books, mostly ornithological.


== Early life ==
Luc Hoffmann was born in Basel, the second son of the businessman and art-lover Emanuel Hoffmann and the sculptor Maja Hoffmann-Stehlin. His father died in a car crash when he was nine years old and the following year his older brother died of leukaemia. His mother then married the Swiss composer Paul Sacher. Despite the family’s great wealth, Hoffmann was raised frugally. His enthusiasm for the natural world developed during his childhood and he spent much of his free time bird watching in the Basel area. His first academic paper, ""Der Durchzug der Strandvögel in der Umgebung Basels"" (the passage of seabirds in the vicinity of Basel) appeared in Der Ornithologische Beobachter (the Bird Observer) in 1941, when he was still a schoolboy.In 1941, he enrolled at the University of Basel, studying botany and zoology. In 1943 he was conscripted into the Swiss Army, rising to the rank of lieutenant. After the end of the second world war, Hoffmann conducted scientific research and earned a doctorate (PhD) for his work on the different color patterns of the chicks of the common tern (Sterna hirundo) in the Camargue on the Mediterranean coast of France. His supervisor at the University of Basel was Adolf Portmann.


== Conservation work ==
In 1947, Hoffmann bought an estate in the Camargue and in 1954 he established the Tour du Valat biological research station on it. The continued presence of greater flamingo (Phoenicopterus roseus) in France has been attributed to conservation work conducted at Tour du Valat. Hoffmann also supported the breeding of Przewalski’s horse (Equus ferus przewalskii) nearby and their reintroduction to their native Mongolia in 2004. Generations of ecologists have trained at Tour du Valat, including John Krebs. More than 60 Ph.D.s have been awarded for research conducted at Tour du Valat by students enrolled at universities in France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Canada and the United Kingdom. From 1953 to 1996, Hoffmann was on the board of Hoffmann-la Roche.With Peter Scott, Julian Huxley, Max Nicholson and others, Hoffmann became a founder member of the World Wildlife Fund in 1961. He was appointed as its vice-president at the inaugural meeting and served in that role until 1988. He was made vice-president emeritus in 1998. Hoffmann helped establish the Doñana National Park in Andalusia in 1963. He also helped set up the national appeal in Austria in 1963 and in the 1980s served as president of the French national appeal.
Hoffmann was one of the founding fathers of the Ramsar Convention, one of the first intergovernmental treaties to protect the environment. The convention aims to conserve wetlands: land that is permanently or periodically covered by shallow water and which typically hosts migratory birds. Some 160 countries have so far contracted to protect their wetlands under the convention, which was devised in 1971 and came into force in 1975.
In 1994, Hoffmann established the MAVA Foundation, which distributes grants for nature conservation in the Mediterranean, the west coast of Africa and the Alps. Yolande Clergue’s original ambition to create a Fondation Van Gogh was given new momentum by Luc Hoffmann who established a permanent framework in 2008 called Fondation Vincent van Gogh Arles for activities designed to preserve the memory of Vincent van Gogh in Arles and to foster contemporary art. In 2012, The MAVA Foundation and WWF International established the Luc Hoffmann Institute to honour the conservation legacy of Luc Hoffmann. The Institute focuses on catalyzing new scientific ideas to solve this century's increasingly complex and interconnected conservation challenges. His son, André Hoffmann, sits on the Institute's Advisory Board.Hoffmann also made significant contributions to nature conservation in: the Neusiedler See in Austria; the Hortobagy National Park in Hungary; the Prespa region that straddles Greece, Albania and Macedonia; and the Banc d’Arguin National Park in Mauritania.In 2003, a major endowment in honour of Hoffmann's eightieth birthday led to the establishment of the Luc Hoffmann Chair in Field Ornithology at Oxford University's Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology.

== Marriage and family ==
Hoffmann's grandfather, Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche, founded the company Hoffmann-La Roche in 1896. He was the son of the industrialist Emanuel ""Manno"" Hoffmann (1896-1932) and the sculptress Maja born Stehlin (1896-1989) and the brother of Vera Oeri-Hoffmann. His family is the majority shareholder in the pharmaceuticals company Hoffmann-La Roche. He used his wealth to endow the MAVA Foundation, which funds nature conservation projects worldwide. He was a chevalier of the National Order of the Légion d’honneur and a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.In 1953, in Vienna, Hoffmann married Daria Razumovsky (1925-2002), the second child of Count Andreas Razumovsky and Princess Katharina Nikolajevna Sayn-Wittgenstein, who fled Russia in 1918 after the October Revolution. Together they had four children: Vera, Maja, André and Daschenka.

He later became a coach, manager and scout.","Joseph Mallett (8 January 1916 – 8 February 2004) was an English professional footballer who spent much of his early playing career at Queens Park Rangers and subsequently at Southampton (playing as a wing half). He later became a coach, manager and scout.


== Playing career ==
Born in Gateshead, Mallett was spotted playing for the Dunston Colliery works team by a London scout, and was signed at the age of seventeen by Charlton Athletic to serve his apprenticeship under manager Jimmy Seed. He had not made any first team appearances before Charlton (then in the First Division) loaned him to Third Division South team Queens Park Rangers to gain experience in April 1937. He remained at QPR until May 1938, making 31 appearances before returning to Charlton, where he appeared twice in the 1938–39 season. In February 1939 Rangers persuaded Charlton to sell him; he was becoming a first-team regular at QPR before his career was interrupted by conscription into the RAF in World War II. During the war he guested for Fulham and West Ham, returning to QPR after the cessation of hostilities.
In February 1947 Bill Dodgin signed him for Southampton for a club record £5000. Although now aged 31, Mallett proved to be a bargain purchase – he was ""a strong link between the defence and attack, and was particularly sound in his positional play."" He made his debut away to Plymouth Argyle on 1 March 1947, scoring one of Saints' goals and making the other in a 3–2 defeat. He soon became the team's captain and had ""forthright views on how the game should be played"". Teammate Alf Ramsey described him as ""having one of the finest of all soccer brains"".When Dodgin left the Saints in August 1949 to be replaced by Sid Cann, Mallett became restless and in January 1950 he put in a transfer request in the hope of receiving a coaching position. The board persuaded him to stay and he remained loyal to Southampton, playing regularly until his last game, away to Nottingham Forest on 29 April 1953. During his Southampton career he made 223 appearances, scoring three goals.


== Coaching career ==
In July 1953, now aged 37, he moved on to Leyton Orient as player-coach, where he was re-united with former QPR teammate Alec Stock. In 1959, he was reserve team coach at Nottingham Forest under Billy Walker and then Andy Beattie, where he brought on a succession of young players, including Ian Storey-Moore and David Pleat.
In June 1964 he joined Birmingham City as coach, and a month later accepted the vacant managerial position. Although he was a proven technical coach with sound judgment of a player – he signed Geoff Vowden and Ron Wylie and gave Malcolm Page his debut – under his management Birmingham won only 13 out of 64 matches and were relegated from the First Division. He remained at the club as assistant manager under Stan Cullis from December 1965 to 1970.
When Cullis retired, Mallett went on to manage Panionios and coach at Apollon in the Greek Super League. Under his management, Panionios achieved their highest finishing position in Greek football (2nd in 1970-71) and won the 1971 Balkans Cup. From 1975 Mallett coached under Gordon Bradley at New York Cosmos in the NASL where he worked with players such as Pelé, Johan Cruyff and Franz Beckenbauer, rejoining Bradley at the Washington Diplomats in 1978, and later coached at San Jose Earthquakes. He also scouted for former club Southampton.


== Personal life ==
He was married to Bertha, whom he first met whilst at Charlton Athletic. They had three sons, Alan, Brian and Francis, and one daughter Julia. Mallett died at his home in Hastings on 8 February 2004 with his family around him.

The Polytechnic Heights community originally grew around the Manchester Cotton Mill and merged with the city of Fort Worth in 1922. The first school associated with the Manchester community was formed in 1886 and replaced by a  new, expanded Polytechnic Heights School in 1907. The class of 1912, Polytechnic's first graduating class, had just eleven students. In 1923, now part of the Fort Worth Public Schools, Polytechnic moved to an even larger building at 1202 Nashville Street and the old building became an elementary school. In 1938, Poly moved two blocks away to its current building, which was designed by renowned local architect, Joseph Pelich.

== Design and development ==
The TK (also known as the TK-3) tankette was a Polish design produced from 1931 based on the chassis of the British Carden Loyd tankette, with an improved hull and more powerful engine, and armour up to 8 mm (0.31 in) thick (10 mm or 0.39 in on the TKS). In 1939, up-arming of the tankettes with Nkm wz.38 FK 20 mm (0.79 in) machine guns began, but only 24 of these were completed before the outbreak of World War II.
On 6 November 1934 Estonia purchased 6 vehicles from Poland, with the contract deal worth over 180,000 krones. The deal also included one additional tracked-lorry, and a motorcycle was given free as a bonus. After the Soviet Union occupied Estonia, these vehicles were put into service with the Red Army.


== Combat history ==
575 TK/TKS tankettes formed the bulk of the Polish armoured forces before the outbreak of war. They suffered heavy losses during the invasion of Poland, often being the only armoured fighting vehicles available. Their small size suited them for reconnaissance and infantry support, but with their light armament of a single machine gun they stood no chance in combat against German tanks, except against the Panzer I. 

The handful of tankettes armed with 20 mm guns were more effective against enemy tanks; in one instance on 18 September 1939 a 20 mm gunned TKS commanded by Podchorazy (Officer Candidate SFC) Roman Orlik destroyed two German Panzerkampfwagen 35(t) tanks and a Panzer IV B tank which was commanded by Victor IV Albrecht von Ratibor.After the conquest of Poland, captured tankettes were used by the German army in various support roles, mostly for training, security duties or as artillery tractors. Many captured tankettes were also used by the Luftwaffe for airfield security and snowplowing. Some were later sold to the puppet state of Croatia. In spring 1941, the National Police received 18 TK-3 tankettes, some with the 20mm gun, while in summer 1941 the Army received 18 TKS, 4 of them being sent to the Ustashe Militia.


== Variants ==

TKF - TK tankette with 46 hp (34 kW) Polski Fiat engine and new (TKS-type) suspension, about 18 built

== Gameplay ==
Presented with a 2D side-view arena with several platforms, the player maneuvers a pegasus-mounted warlord. Left and right movement is inertia-heavy, as is 'flap' movement against gravity. In one difference with the arcade version of Joust, the flap key may be held down rather than tapped.
Collision with a computer-controlled enemy results in one warlord being dismounted, depending on who had the altitudinal advantage. If the player is dismounted, he loses one of four lives. If the enemy is dismounted, the figure tumbles downwards as his mount flies away. This dismounted warlord may be attacked again for bonus points. If left unattended, the warlord eventually calls a new mount and re-enters the battle (coloured magenta instead of cyan.) Occasionally the Winged Warlord equivalent of Joust's pterodactyl will appear; the Evil Bird of War (which appears to be some kind of large duck.) Contact with this is lethal for the player; it must be avoided as it makes its way across the screen.


== Reception ==
CRASH magazine reviewed Winged Warlords in its third issue, awarding it 79%, while Sinclair User gave it 6/10; generally receiving better critical success than other Spectrum Joust clones such as Softek's Ostron.

The film is also known as Attack Force 'Nam (American DVD title), P.O.W. the Escape (American reissue title).


== Plot ==
Colonel Cooper (David Carradine) is a U.S. Airborne commando who comes to Vietnam with a special mission to liberate imprisoned American soldiers. He gets caught in a North Vietnamese POW camp where there are other Paratroopers and Soldiers. Action is set at the end of the war and he, as the highest-ranking officer in the POW camp, is to be sent to Hanoi and prosecuted by the North Vietnamese. Camp commander Vinh (Mako Iwamatsu) gets an order to send him to court but instead of obeying it, he offers Cooper a deal - he will help him get to the American sector and then Cooper, in return, would help him immigrate to the United States, where Vinh has family.
Cooper promptly disregards his proposition, as he is a tough soldier who would rather sacrifice his own life than help the enemy. However Vinh is persistent persuading him, threatening that if he will not accept his deal, then all of the fellow prisoners from his camp will die. Given that threat Cooper reconsiders Vinh's offer, and accepts the deal, but under one condition - all of the camp prisoners must go with them. Vinh, being short of time (as Hanoi set deadline for sending Cooper to court) OK's the plan and so they leave camp in column of two jeeps and a truck (prisoners are hidden in a tank truck while Cooper goes with Vinh in a jeep). Their journey won't be without obstacles as they need to go through zones controlled by The North Vietnamese, and through the jungle wilderness.

== History ==


=== Origins ===
In February 1858 the New Plymouth Battalion of Militia was called up in anticipation of conflict with the local Māori. By the end of August, however, the New Zealand Government decided the militia was too expensive to maintain and they were disbanded. Many of the militiamen were dismayed by the decision and resolved in September to form the a volunteer corps. The volunteers received new Enfield Rifles in December and the formation of the Taranaki Volunteer Rifle Company was officially proclaimed by Governor Thomas Browne on 13 January 1859. The corps was formed into two companies: no.1 company under Captain Isaac Watt, a future Member of Parliament, and no.2 company under Captain Harry Atkinson, a future Premier of New Zealand and later commander of the unit.


=== First Taranaki War ===

In late 1859 the New Zealand Government had organised to purchase the Pekapeka block from the minor Te Āti Awa chief, Te Teira Manuka. However a more senior chief, Wiremu Kīngi, opposed the purchase and the disagreement led to the outbreak of the First Taranaki War in March 1860. The Taranaki Volunteers were mobilised and on 28 March, were sent to help evacuate settlers from outlying areas into New Plymouth. The 103 strong company of volunteers, along with men from the militia, 65th Regiment and HMS Niger became engaged with Māori near the Waireka stream. The volunteers set up a defensive position around a farm house below Kaipopo Pā, but late in the day became isolated when the 65th withdrew (as they were under orders to retire to New Plymouth before nightfall). Fortunately a further detachment from HMS Niger had landed in the afternoon and joined the battle at dusk. They fired rockets at, and later stormed, the pā, forcing the Māori to withdraw. The volunteers then withdrew to New Plymouth during the night. The Battle of Waireka was lauded as a British victory over a much larger Māori force. The volunteer's casualties were four wounded, out of a total of 14 British casualties, while the Māori casualties were estimated to be about 100. Some modern historians, however, argue that the Māori casualties were likely minimal and that in reality victory lay with the Māori who were able to continue to raid the evacuated farms. Waireka was the first time a British Empire reservist unit had been committed to battle.The volunteers spent the winter of 1860 defending New Plymouth and three volunteers were killed in ambushes during patrols. In spring a war party of Ngāti Hauā, led by Wetini Taiporutu, arrived in Taranaki and crossed the Waitara on 5 November. Wetini had sent a letter to the British inviting them to battle and it was feared they intended to attack New Plymouth. Major General Thomas Pratt (commander of the British forces in Australasia) immediately issued orders to repulse the Māori. A large British contingent included 90 Taranaki Volunteers, attacked Wetini's force at an old, practically unfortified pā site at Māhoetahi. The volunteers deployed on the left with the militia, while the 65th regiment was on the right. Two 24-pounder Howitzers of the Royal Artillery supported the attack. The battle culminated in a bayonet charge which forced the Māori to fall back from the pā. The retreating Māori became trapped against a swamp and were encircled by the British forces. The Taranaki Volunteers lost 2 men killed and 4 wounded, while the British regulars took a further 15 casualties. Approximately two-thirds of the 150-strong Māori force were believed to be either killed or wounded. The volunteers remained in New Plymouth for the rest of the war, which ended in March 1861.


=== Second Taranaki War ===

The Second Taranaki War broke out in May 1863 when soldiers of the 57th Regiment tried to evict Māori at Tataraimaka. Unlike the first war, the Volunteers received permission from the new British commander, Colonel Henry Warre, to operate outside the town limits. Two 45-man bushranger companies were formed and equipped with breech loading Calisher and Terry carbines. The Bushrangers patrolled the area surrounding New Plymouth, deterring Māori raiding parties and defending the farmsteads. From September the Māori became more active and the volunteers were involved in a number of actions. In October a group of men from the 57th Regiment were ambushed by Māori at Allen's hill and the volunteers came to their aid. The arrival of more British forces prompted the Māori to pull back and so the volunteers were not seriously engaged. Māori losses are unknown, but the 57th lost one man killed and 8 wounded, while 2 men received the Victoria Cross. The next year, in March 1864, Warre attacked Kaitake pā. The volunteers moved through the bush to attack the palisade from behind, while other units attacked the palisade from the front. The Māori withdrew and only suffered only one man killed, while the pā was captured without loss to the British (although two men of the 57th Regiment were wounded when pulling down the palisade). The Taranaki Rifles Volunteers' final action of the war was the storming of Manutahi pā in October 1864. Colonel Warre noted that the volunteers had hitherto not been seriously engaged and gave them the honour of leading the attack. The volunteers attacked the pā from two sides and came under fire, but the Māori defenders soon fled. One of the volunteers was wounded during this action, while one Māori was killed and another two were wounded. Peace was declared by Governor George Grey on 25 October 1864, however the conflict would continue for some time and the bushrangers would skirmish with Māori at Warea in June 1865.


=== Late Victorian Period ===

The Taranaki Volunteers were disbanded in 1866, but later reformed in 1876. The corps was expanded to three companies in 1879 and mobilized in 1881, when the government sent more than 1500 troops, including 51 men of the Taranaki Volunteers, to Parihaka. The Māori pacifist leader, Te Whiti o Rongomai, had been leading a resistance campaign against the New Zealand government since its occupation of land in the Waimate Plains in 1879. Parihaka was perceived as his base of resistance and so the village was destroyed by the government forces. Te Whiti was arrested and the village's inhabitants were dispersed.In 1886, the Taranaki Volunteers, along with numerous other volunteers corps, were merged into the West Coast (North Island) Battalion of Rifle Volunteers. The battalion was disbanded in 1888, although the Taranaki Volunteers continued to exist as an independent unit. The New Zealand volunteer corps were again formed into battalions in 1895, with the Taranaki Volunteers becoming D Company, Wellington Battalion Infantry Volunteers and later redesignated as C Company, 2nd Battalion, Wellington (West Coast) Rifle Volunteers in 1898. A further reorganisation in 1901 saw the Taranki Volunteers become A Company of the newly established 4th Battalion, Wellington (Taranaki) Rifle Volunteers, which comprised exclusively of Taranaki-based volunteer corps.During the Second Boer War (1899-1902), the New Zealand Government sent a number of mounted rifles contingents to fight in South Africa. The Taranaki Volunteers provided 25 men to these contingents, the second largest contribution by any New Zealand volunteer corps. A further two members of the corps served with other British Empire units.The New Zealand territorial force was formed in 1910 and a system of compulsory military training replaced the old volunteer system. Following these reforms, in 1911 the 4th Battalion became an independent regiment: the 11th (Taranaki Rifles) Regiment. Lieutenant Colonel William Malone, who had become the unit commander in 1910, introduced the Lemon Squeezer as the regimental hat in 1911. The lemon Squeezer was designed to help let rainwater run off the hat, while also alluding to the shape of Mount Taranaki. The rest of the New Zealand Military Forces adopted the Lemon Squeezer in 1916 and it continues to be worn by the New Zealand Army today. In 1913 
the Governor of New Zealand, the Earl of Liverpool, was appointed Honorary Colonel of the regiment.


=== First World War ===

At the outbreak of war in August 1914, the decision was made to form a New Zealand infantry brigade of four battalions from the existing territorial regiments. Men from the 11th Regiment (Taranaki Rifles) formed the 11th (Taranaki) Company of the Wellington Infantry Regiment, which saw service during the Gallipoli Campaign. Malone was appointed to command the Wellington Regiment, but was killed in 1915 at the Battle of Chunuk Bair during which the regiment suffered a 90% casualty rate. Following the evacuation from Gallipoli in 1916, the regiment was expanded to two battalions. The Wellington Regiment would see action on the western front, engaging in the battles of the Somme, Messines, Broodseinde, Passchendaele, German Spring Offensive and the Hundred Days' Offensive. A third battalion was also raised in 1917, but was disbanded in 1918 due to manpower shortages. Both the 2nd and 3rd battalions were organised along the same lines as the 1st Battalion, each with their own eponymous 11th (Taranaki) Company. The Wellington Regiment was disbanded at the end of the war.One member of the 11th (Taranaki Rifles) Regiment, Sergeant John Grant, won the Victoria Cross during the First World War. Grant, who was serving with 1st Battalion, Wellington Regiment at the time, received the award for clearing a number of machine gun posts during the Second Battle of Bapaume.


=== Inter War ===

In 1921, the New Zealand territorial regiments were reorganised into larger regiments, similar to those of the First World War, with the 11th (Taranaki) Regiment becoming the 4th Battalion, Wellington Regiment. The amalgamations were short lived and in 1923, the previous organisation was reverted to, although the ordinals were dropped and the regiment became the Taranaki Regiment.A similar organisation occurred in 1937. The Taranaki Regiment was reduced to a depot and supplied a rifle company to the 2nd Composite Battalion. The new Battalion also had rifle companies from the Wellington West Coast and Hawkes Bay regiments. The composite system was abandoned in May 1939, just prior to the outbreak of war and the territorial regiments were brought up to their war establishment.


=== Second World War ===
During the Second World War, the Taranaki Regiment remained in New Zealand for home defence. A second battalion was formed in 1942 by redesignating the 14th Battalion of the National Military Reserve. The 2nd Battalion was an independent battalion and was intended to defend Taranaki, while the 1st Battalion became part of 2nd Infantry Brigade, 4th Division, and was expected to provide a mobile response to any invasion throughout the country. The territorial forces was stood down in June 1943 and the 2nd Battalion was formally disbanded in April 1944.Men from the regiment saw active service overseas with the 19th, 22nd, 25th and 36th battalions  of the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force. A Taranaki Company was formed in each of the 19th, 22nd and 25th battalions, similar to the Wellington Regiment of the First World War. These battalions formed part of the 2nd New Zealand Division and saw action in Greece, Crete, North Africa, Tunisia and Italy. The 36th Battalion, was deployed to the Pacific with the 3rd New Zealand Division and saw combat at the Treasury Islands.


=== Amalgamation ===
The Taranaki Regiment was amalgamated with the Wellington West Coast Regiment in 1948 and became the Wellington West Coast and Taranaki Regiment. The amalgamated regiment would later become the 5th Battalion, Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment and celebrated their 150th birthday in 2008, derived from the Taranaki Volunteer Rifle Company.


== Battle Honours and Colours ==
The Taranki Volunteer Rifle Company was presented an unofficial regimental colour on 25 June 1861. The colour was emblazoned with the battle honour ""Waireka"" and later had ""South Africa"" added to them. In 1913, the other territorial regiments dropped the word ""rifles"" from their titles so that they could be authorised to carry colours (rifle regiments do not carry colours). The 11th Regiment (Taranaki Rifles) were the only regiment which decided to retain the designation as rifles and, despite an appeal to be made an exception to the rule, were not formally authorised to carry colours. When the Taranaki Regiment applied for colours in the early 1930s (no longer being a rifle regiment), the Army Council took exception to the battle honour ""Waireka"". They argued that ""Waireka"" was not an authorised battle honour and pointed out that it had not been awarded to other British units which had been present at the battle. After much correspondence, it was decided to award the regiment the battle honour ""New Zealand"". The Taranaki Regiment was the only regiment of the New Zealand Military Forces to bear this battle honour until the formation of the New Zealand Regiment in 1947 (which inherited the Battle honours of all the New Zealand territorial infantry regiments). It is sometimes claimed that the Taranaki regiment was the only British Commonwealth regiment to bear its own country's name as a battle honour. Many Canadian regiments, however, bear the honour ""Defence of Canada 1812-1815"" and likewise some South African regiments were awarded ""South Africa 1899-1902"". The Taranaki Regiment were presented with a new stand of colours on 22 March 1936. The new colours were emblazoned with a further ten battle honours from the First World War and were laid up in St Mary's Church on 10 December 1972. The colours of both the Taranaki Volunteer Rifles and the Taranaki Regiment were temporarily removed form the church during restorations in 2016.The Taranaki Regiment were awarded the following battle honours:
New Zealand Wars: New Zealand*
Boer War: South Africa 1899-1902*
First World War: Anzac, Landing at Anzac*, Defence of Anzac, Suvla, Sari Bair*, Gallipolli 1915*, Helles, Krithia, Suez Canal, Egypt 1915-16*, Somme 1916,18*; Flers-Courcelette, Morval, Polygon Wood, Messines 1917*, Broodseinde, Ypres 1917*, Passendale, Arras 1918, Albert 1918, Bapaume 1918*, Hindenburg Line*, Havrincourt, Canal du Nord, Cambrai 1918, Selle, Sambre, Le Transloy, France and Flanders 1916–1918*(*denotes battle honours emblazoned on the colours)
The Taranaki Regiment did not receive any battle honours during the Second World War. However, in 1958, the regiment's descendant unit, the Wellington West Coast and Taranaki Regiment, inherited the battle honours of the 19th, 22nd, 25th and 36th battalions with which men from the Taranaki Regiment served.

== History ==

Knaresborough is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Chenaresburg, meaning ""Cenheard's fortress"", in the wapentake of Burghshire, renamed Claro Wapentake in the 12th century. Knaresborough Castle is Norman; around 1100, the town began to grow. It provided a market and attracted traders to service the castle. The parish church, St John's, was established around this time. The earliest identified Lord of Knaresborough is around 1115 when Serlo de Burgh held the Honour of Knaresborough from the King.Hugh de Morville was granted the Honour of Knaresborough in 1158. He was constable of Knaresborough and leader of the group of four knights who murdered Archbishop Thomas Becket at Canterbury Cathedral on 29 December 1170. The four knights fled to Knaresborough and hid at the castle. Hugh de Morville forfeited the lands in 1173, not for his implication in the murder of Thomas Becket, but for ""complicity in the rebellion of Henry the Young King"", according to the Early Yorkshire Charters.
The Honour of Knaresborough then passed to the Stuteville family. When the Stuteville line was broken with the death of Robert the 4th (son of Robert 3rd) in 1205, King John effectively took the Honour of Knaresborough for himself. The first Maundy Money was distributed in Knaresborough by King John on 15 April 1210. Knaresborough Forest, which extended far to the south of the town, is reputed to have been one of King John's favourite hunting grounds.
Although a market was first mentioned in 1206, the town was not granted a Royal Charter to hold a market until 1310, by Edward II. A market is still held every Wednesday in the market square. In Edward II's reign, the castle was occupied by rebels and the curtain walls were breached by a siege engine. Later, Scots invaders burned much of the town and the parish church. In 1328, as part of the marriage settlement, Queen Philippa was granted ""the Castle, Town, Forest and Honour of Knaresborough"" by Edward III and the parish church was restored. After her death in 1369, the Honour was granted by Edward to their younger son, John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster and since then the castle has belonged to the Duchy of Lancaster. After the accession of Henry IV the castle lost much of its importance in national affairs, but remained a key site in regional administration for another century.
In the Civil War, following the Battle of Marston Moor in 1644, the castle was besieged by Parliamentary forces. The castle eventually fell and in 1646 an order was made by Parliament for its destruction (but not carried out till 1648). The destruction was mainly done by citizens looting the stone. Many town centre buildings are built of castle stone.
The railway age began in Knaresborough in 1848 with the opening of a railway station on Hay Park Lane; this was replaced with the current one three years later in 1851.  The town had a railway line to Boroughbridge until it closed to passengers in 1950; it was dismantled in 1964.
Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, Knaresborough became part of North Yorkshire in 1974.


== Culture and community ==

Knaresborough House on the High Street houses Knaresborough Town Council and the Yorkshire Federation of Young Farmers' Clubs.Knaresborough hosts the annual Bed Race, organised by the Knaresborough Lions Club. It is held on the second Saturday of June. The event was first staged in 1966.An annual town centre arts summer festival, the Festival of Entertainment and Visual Arts, has run since 2001.Knaresborough hosts a parkrun, Conyngham Hall parkrun, which started in May 2019.  It takes place every Saturday at Conyngham Hall, with the exception of Bed Race day.
The town was used in the opening election sequence in the first episode of the ITV comedy series The New Statesman and some exterior shots for the series were filmed around Knaresborough. The town also featured in the 2019 American television film A Very British Christmas, for which it was a principal shooting location.

A plaque in Market Place, placed by the Knaresborough Civic Society, commemorates the 13th century Synagogue to the rear of the Market Place. The plaque indicates that in the 13th century a Jewish community lived and worshipped in Knaresborough. The synagogue was situated at the exit to Synagogue Lane, the exact location of which is unknown.

=== Championship playoff ===
Tirana and Tomori finished the season level on points so the Albanian Football Association decided to organise a championship playoff game to determine the winner of the 1999–2000 Albanian National Championship. The game was played at Ruzhdi Bizhuta Stadium in Elbasan and Tirana won on penalties following a 1–1 draw to retain their title. Had the league been decided on goal difference Tirana would have won it, but if it had been decided on their head-to-head record Tomori would have won it.

The books were previously self-published as a Six-volume series selling 90,000 copies


== Plot ==
Book 1: The Crown Conspiracy (Theft of Swords)After a successful raid, Royce and Hadrian (together known as Riyria) are approached by a man offering much gold to steal a sword owned by Count Pickering, from the royal palace in Medford, the capital of the kingdom of Melengar. While searching for the sword they discover the dead body of the King, and are accused of his murder.  Arista, Princess of Melengar, saves them from execution.  In return, they kidnap her brother, Alric, because she thinks he will also be killed. Following Arista's instructions, Riyria and Alric make their way to the prison where the wizard Esrahaddon is being held.  On the way, they are ambushed on a river and come across a burned monastery, whose only survivor, Myron, joins the group. While the group travels to the prison, Arista grows suspicious of her uncle Percy Braga. She uses magic taught to her by Esrahaddon to confirm that Braga had a hand in her father's death. Braga accuses her of witchcraft and has her imprisoned for murdering her father.  At the prison, Alric frees Esrahaddon, who reveals that he was falsely imprisoned for murdering the emperor and destroying the empire nearly a thousand years ago. After giving the group some advice on what to do next, Esrahaddon leaves to pursue something he started before he was imprisoned. While eating and planning their next move at a local inn a group of soldiers arrive and make trouble for the owner and patrons. Alric steps in to intervene and proves his identity as the prince and future king. The group decides to go their separate ways now that Alric is with his soldiers and Riyria has completed their job.
After Alric leaves, Royce and Hadrian deduce that Alric is with a group of mercenaries, most likely employed by whoever murdered his father. After killing the mercenaries (whom Myron recognizes as the men who burned down the abbey), the group then attempts to return to Medford, but soon realize that Braga has seized power there. Braga discusses with his co-conspirator, who is revealed to be Bishop Saldur. Saldur explains that since the fall of the old empire, a thousand years ago, the church has been working to place their agents in positions of power in every kingdom in order to establish a new empire. With Alric's presumed death and Arista scheduled for execution, Braga is poised to become king and potentially emperor. Alric goes to Drondil Fields, where he enlists the Pickerings (loyal family friends) to help raise an army to defeat Percy. There the group meet Count Pickering and his sons Fanen and Mauvin, who were unaware of the king's death. When Hadrian and Mauvin spar it is revealed that Hadrian knows the ancient and forgotten Teshlor fighting style that made knights of the old empire unstoppable. Riyria infiltrates the city and asks Royce's lover, Gwen DeLancy, to incite a riot to distract the guards from the army marches toward Medford. While Royce saves Arista from her tower that was rigged to collapse, Hadrian holds Braga at bay. When Alric sees his troops begin to die for him he charges ahead and demands to be let in. The commoners who have taken the gate, open it to let the army through. Count Pickering duels Braga and decapitates him. Although the coup is stopped, no one is aware of Saldur's involvement and he crowns Alric king. Myron is given the materials to rebuild the abbey, which will be an exact replica due to his photographic memory. Sometime later Riyria places Braga's head on the lap of a sleeping conspirator as a warning to the enemies of Melengar.

Book 2: Avempartha (Theft of Swords)Almost a year after the events of the previous book, Royce and Hadrian have tracked down the man who enlisted their help to steal Count Pickering's sword and framed them for the king's murder. Confronting him in the merchant city of Colnora, they discover that he is a simple sailor named Wyatt, who took the job as a way to care for his adopted daughter, Allie. Royce decides to spare Wyatt after seeing Allie (who is half elf). Riyria starts to head out of the city, but is stopped by an old associate of Royce's. It's revealed that Royce was once a member of a feared criminal guild called the Black Diamond and was tricked into assassinating his best friend's lover, who in return had Royce sent to Manzant prison. Riyria is informed that a young girl named Thrace is looking to hire them. After tracking her down and saving her from being raped, she explains that a dragon-like creature is terrorizing her village, Dhalgren. Although she is unable to pay their standard fee, Royce agrees when she mentions a man who matches Esrahaddon's description staying at the village. Meanwhile, King Alric has Arista appointed as an ambassador. While traveling to meet with the king of a nearby kingdom of Rhenyyd, her coach stops at Ervanon to meet with Archbishop Galien and Bishop Saldur. The Bishops question her about her relationship with Esrahaddon and reveal that he might have had a hand in her father's death. Though she dodges most of their questions, she begins to have doubts about Esrahaddon. Saldur joins her on her way to Rhenyyd. Arista meets with the king of Rhenyyd, who does not treat her seriously, because she is a woman and a rumor that she is a witch. During the meeting Arista notices mir (elves mixed with humans) slaves being treated poorly by the king. Riryia and Thrace arrive at Dhalgren to find that more of the villagers have been killed since Thrace left. They meet Thrace's father Theron, who is preparing to hunt the monster. While he is dismissive of Thrace, Theron is determined to kill the beast who killed the rest of his family.
Hadrian deduces that hunting the beast is Theron's suicide attempt. The monster attacks that night killing another villager, but Royce catches a glimpse of it. Esrahaddon reveals himself and explains the monster is actually an ancient elven magical construct, that the elves used in a war against humans thousands of years ago, called a Gilarabrywn. He explains that only a sword with the creature's true name carved into the blade can kill it, which is located in an elven tower at the edge of a waterfall. Esrahaddon explains that the tower was once the elve's last standing stronghold between the humans and their homeland. Finding no way across, the human emperor built a bridge to cross over and won the war. The tower became a storage facility for magic weapons and when the last emperor met with the elves at a peace summit, a Gilarabrywn was activated by anti-human elves. To save the emperor Esrahaddon magically sealed the tower to trap the Gilarabrywn, resulting in the death of everyone inside. Royce surmises that over 1,000 years later someone has freed the Gilarabrywn for an unknown reason. Meanwhile, Arista meets Mauvin and Fanen while traveling to a tournament site and determines that Dahlgren is hosting it. Saldur and Galien meet and it is revealed that they unleashed the Gilarabrywn. Their plan is to pronounce whoever kills the creature the Heir of Novron (the first Emperor) and rule the world through him. They give their chosen warrior a sword that they believe will instantly kill the Gilarabrywn.
Arriving at Dahlgren the bishops evict the townspeople from the fortified manor leaving them unprotected. When the Gilarabrwyn attacks again, the bishop's sword is revealed as a fake and their chosen warrior killed. The keep is razed and Galien is killed. Royce leaves with Arista and Esrahaddon to try and reclaim the real sword. Hadrian, Mauvin, and Fanen discover a trio of Seret knights (the bishop's personal enforcers) and defend themselves against them. In the fight, Fanen and Theron are killed and the Gilabrwyn returns. While Royce searches for the sword, Esrahaddon and Arista tap into the magic built into the tower. They use the tower to find the magical pendants given to the true heir of Novron and his protector, by Esrahaddon 1,000 years ago. Royce finds the sword broken in half and they return to the village. After a devastating fight that destroys most of the village Thrace plunges the broken sword into the Gilabrywn. Having countless people witness her kill the beast, the bishops have no choice but to name her Empress, but Thrace is left in a catatonic state after her father's death. Saldur decides to rule the newly minted Empire through her and annexes every kingdom except Melengar, as his plan to implant a leader there loyal to him failed in the last book. The book ends with the threat of Melengar standing alone against the powerful new Empire.

Book 3: Nyphron Rising (Rise of Empire)Rise of Empire picks up some time after the events of Theft of Swords. The newly minted Empire, under the regency of Bishop Saldur, is at war with Melengar.
The Empress Modina, formerly the young farm girl Thrace, has been kept out of sight of the populace, being treated as little more than a prisoner in her catatonic state. Through a series of dumb luck, a scullery maid is placed in charge of training the Empress. It is her kindness and compassion toward the young Empress that eventually helps Modina break through her numbness and start to become a person again.
Royce and Hadrian, meanwhile, have been employed by King Alric to provide valuable information to aid in the war against the Empire.

It was used by the Italian Naval Aviation and was later flown by crews from the United States Navy.


== Design and development ==
The M.8 was similar to earlier flying boat designs from the company but introduced new rigid wing bracing (or interplane struts). The hull was improved from earlier designs and the tail unit was similar to that developed for the M.7. It was a biplane flying boat with the pilot and co-pilot in a side-by-side open cockpit with a further open cockpit forward of them for an observer. The third cockpit was fitted with a machine gun ring and there was access inside the hull between the cockpits. The M.8 was powered by a single Isotta-Fraschini V.4B pusher engine mounted below the upper wing.
A total of 57 aircraft were built between 1917 and 1918 and were used for coastal reconnaissance and to attack enemy submarines. After World War I, a number of surviving aircraft were used at seaplane flying schools for instruction.

It is located on the Grand Parade to the west of the Castle and is built from honey-coloured oolitic limestone imported from Bath in England.


== History ==
The building was designed as the result of a public competition, the winning architects being Messrs Harry Austin Reid and Frederick George Green, with the contractors being Messrs T. Howard and F. G. Scott. Much of the building material, including fixtures and fittings was imported from Europe.

The Organ was built by Messrs Norman and Beard of London and Norwich, the specifications were drawn up by Sir George Martin, organist of St Paul's Cathedral in London especially for the City Hall. The workmanship and materials are of high quality, and the organ made from mahogany, teak and pine. Sir George Martin spoke of it as “a magnificent instrument in every gradation of tone, from the softest stop to the most powerful tuba being found in the organ, and all under the most perfect control, and that altogether the instrument must be regarded as an artistic and mechanical triumph”. There are altogether 3165 pipes varying from 32 feet (10 metres) to 3⁄4 inch (19 millimetres). The wind was supplied by a Kinetic Blower worked by an electric motor.
The tower of the City Hall has a Turret Clock which strikes the hours and chimes the Westminster quarters. The faces of the clock are made from 4 skeleton iron dials filled with opal. The clock has a 24-hour wheel and lever. The bells were cast by Messrs John Taylor and Co of Loughborough and the clock was supplied by JB Joyce & Co of Whitchurch.
The City Hall's carillon was installed as a World War I war memorial, with 22 additional bells being added in 1925 with the visit of the Prince of Wales.
On February 11, 1990, only hours after his release from prison, Nelson Mandela made his first public speech from the balcony of Cape Town City Hall.
On 2 January 2022, the National Assembly building of the Parliament of South Africa was severely damaged in a fire at the parliamentary precinct. The City of Cape Town subsequently made the City Hall and Grand Parade available for President Cyril Ramaphosa's State of the Nation Address. On 7 January, Parliament announced that Ramaphosa's State of the Nation Address will take place at the City Hall on 10 February. It will be attended by 300 Members of Parliament (MPs) and 70 guests to comply with COVID-19 regulations.The hall was lit up in the colours of the Ukrainian flag on the night of 2 March 2022 to show the city's support for the country during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.


== Contemporary use ==
The City Hall no longer houses the offices of the City of Cape Town, which are located in the Cape Town Civic Centre. From 1982 to 2008 it hosted the Central Library, which has since moved to the adjacent Old Drill Hall. The City Hall has become a central venue for creative and cultural events such as art exhibitions and concerts. One of these events includes the City Hall Sessions.
Perhaps the most widely publicized event held at the Cape Town City Hall is the Festive Lights Switch On, hosted by the City of Cape Town. The event is free to all, and includes top local performers, musicians and a projection mapping display on the facade of the building.


== Statue of Nelson Mandela ==
On 24 July 2018, a statue of Nelson Mandela on the balcony overlooking the Grand Parade was unveiled. It was on the same spot where he made a speech when he was released from prison on 11 February 1990. A 3D computer model of the Nelson Mandela Statue was also created. The 3D model is based on terrestrial laser scanning and photogrammetry.

== Documentation with 3D Laser Scanning ==
Between 2017 and 2018, the Zamani Project documented the Cape Town City Hall with terrestrial 3D laser scanning.  A textured 3D model and a Virtual-Tour (Panorama-Tour) is available on the City of Cape Town's website (http://www.capetown.gov.za). The non-profit research group from the University of Cape town (South Africa) specialises in 3D digital documentation of tangible cultural heritage. The data generated by the Zamani Project creates a permanent record that can be used for research, education, restoration, and conservation.

The film stars David Oakes, Tom Kane, Jennie Jacques, Liam Boyle, Jack Gordon, Florence Hall and Alexander Vlahos. It made 2.5 million at the box office  against its budget of 1 million.


== Plot ==
The film opens at an end-of-term Halloween house party, where a quiet guy named Felix (Tom Kane) enters, alone. A group of friends is there too, including Chris (Jack Gordon), a spoilt brat, with his mild-mannered girlfriend, Gemma (Florence Hall), his friend Paul (Liam Boyle), with his girlfriend, the abrasive Eleanor (Jennie Jacques), and his drug-dealer friend, Luke (Alexander Vlahos).
Felix appears fond of Gemma and watches her from a distance for most of the party, catching Luke's attention. Luke provides Felix with cocaine, and convinces him to go and talk to her (although knowing of the upcoming consequences). Felix asks her out but she politely turns him down.
Meanwhile, Paul and Eleanor attempt to have sex in an upstairs room, but Paul passes out drunk. Dejected, Eleanor decides instead to play truth or dare with the other party guests, downstairs.
The bottle is spun and lands on Felix, who chooses truth, and Eleanor asks him to pick anyone he would like to fulfill his fantasy with. Begrudgingly, he chooses Gemma, who appears somewhat embarrassed. Chris grows jealous and taunts Felix, before punching him. Gemma dumps Chris and runs to console Felix.
Months later, after the Christmas holidays, all five friends get an invitation to Felix's surprise birthday party. 
It is revealed that Felix comes from a very wealthy family, and this is realised when they arrive at his home; a beautiful, but seemingly abandoned mansion. 
After trying to find a way into the building, they are interrupted by the groundsman, Woodbridge (David Sterne), who tells them the correct address; a small shack half a mile down the beaten track, in the forest behind the mansion.
They walk through the woods to the shack, where they are welcomed by a mysterious, handsome man named Justin (David Oakes), who reveals himself to be the elder brother of Felix.
Justin reveals that due to last-minute flight cancellation, Felix will be unable to join them for the party, but welcomes them to stay for drinks anyway. The group start to make themselves comfortable and discover that Justin is a well-trained soldier, having recently returned from three tours of Afghanistan. Justin is also revealed to be particularly homophobic, frequently and casually throwing gay slurs.
Justin suggests they play a game of truth or dare to liven up the party, and before long begins asking them questions regarding the night of the Halloween party, and reveals to everyone that he lied about Felix's absence.
He tells them that Felix actually hung himself from the roof of the shack, the night after the party, with nothing but a postcard in his pocket marked ""Truth or Dare, bitch!"" (something Chris had said to him previously). Justin threatens that no one can leave until he knows who wrote the postcard, that he believes drove his brother to suicide.
He goes on to explain how Felix's suicide has brought great shame to his family (being both highly religious and respected), and the only way to reconcile this shame is to bring justice to those deemed responsible.
When the group tries to leave, Justin shoots Chris in the leg, and convinces Luke to act as his partner throughout the night, and tie up everyone else.
Justin insists on continuing their game of truth or dare by incorporating a torture method he calls 'The Acid Test', whereby Gemma is force-fed a tube attached to two jars of identical clear liquid; one is said to be filled with tap water, and the other battery acid. Justin forces Chris to choose a jar, and fortunately he chooses the one containing water.
Justin later swaps the roles, force-feeding Chris the tube, and forcing Paul to choose a jar. With Justin having swapped the position of the jars, Paul unintentionally chooses the one containing acid, and Chris chokes to death, bleeding heavily from his mouth.
Before Justin can continue, the group is interrupted by an intruder, knocking at the door (who is revealed to be Luke's drug-dealer friend, Jonesy (Jason Maza), who followed them to the party).
After Luke fails to convince Jonesy to leave, Justin intervenes by breaking his arm and threatening to shoot him, before handing the gun to Luke and gives him an ultimatum; given there is a 50-50 chance of firing either a blank or a bullet, he can either risk shooting Jonesy, killing him, or shooting Justin, and being able to leave with his surviving friends. Justin assures Luke should he shoot a blank at Jonesy, he can go free, but should he shoot a blank at him, he will kill him instead. Reluctantly, Luke shoots at Jonesy, killing him.
Meanwhile, Gemma loosens her binds and escapes through the back window.
Upon returning to the shack and finding Gemma missing, Justin leaves to find her, while Luke remains to keep watch on Paul and Eleanor.
Gemma reaches the mansion, and searches for help, but is terrified to find Felix, alive but bed-ridden and almost completely paralysed.
Woodbridge arrives and, aiming a shotgun at Gemma, reveals that it was he who found Felix hanging in the shack and has been caring for him ever since - he and Gemma get into a scuffle, and in an attempt to wrestle his gun away from her, he is fatally wounded.
Justin arrives at the house, and breaks Gemma's neck in front of Felix, before taunting his brother with her corpse.
Meanwhile, back at the shack, Luke is reluctant to free Paul and Eleanor, claiming that as he has gained Justin's trust and is also responsible for killing Jonesy, he hopes Justin will use his connections to keep him from punishment. He also reveals that it was him who sent the postcard.
However, after convincing him to help her snort cocaine while she is tied up, Eleanor bites off Luke's little finger, sending him flying backwards and impaling himself in the back of the head on a tool lying on the floor, killing him.
Freeing themselves, Paul and Eleanor attempt to escape, but with Paul's leg wound bleeding out they do not get far, before Justin returns with Felix, in a wheelchair.
The three break out into a brawl, wherein Eleanor manages to both shoot Justin in the shoulder, and severely scald him by smashing the jar of battery acid over his head.
Justin later awakens tied to a post by Eleanor, as Paul attempts to start Justin's car outside for them to make their escape. 
Eleanor reveals that it was never really the postcard that drove Felix to suicide, but in fact, a video she had blackmailed him with in exchange for money to help save her father's failing business. 
She explains that after Felix was humiliated in the game of truth or dare, she seduced and convinced him to perform oral sex on the unconscious Paul, upstairs - the fear of his brother discovering his questionable sexuality was what led Felix to attempted suicide.
She then gives Felix a grenade and escapes with Paul, while the house blows up, killing both the brothers.

== Production ==


=== Development ===
The Gossip Girl book series was originally supposed to be adapted into a film starring Lindsay Lohan with head Gilmore Girls creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. When the film project did not get off the ground, Stephanie Savage and Josh Schwartz took over the project to create a television series. As of October 2006, Schwartz was working on the pilot. He said, ""I was very skeptical. I don't want to do The O.C. NYC. But I thought the books were smart. The characters are worldly in a way that Orange County kids aren't."" The characteristics for each character in the pilot were based on the first Gossip Girl book. In January 2007, the show was given the green light by The CW.


=== Production team ===
The O.C. creator Josh Schwartz and fellow writer Stephanie Savage served as the show's executive producers throughout the series' run, followed by Bob Levy and Leslie Morgenstein of Alloy Entertainment, who were assigned in aiding the adaptation of the novels into the series. Following the success of Gossip Girl, Gilmore Girls co-producer, John Stephens was approached by Schwartz and Savage, having previously worked with him on The O.C., and hired him as an executive producer. Joshua Safran, who started as a writer/consulting producer before becoming co-executive producer, was later added as an executive producer. On April 24, 2012, it was announced that he would leave the show at the end of the fifth season to be the new showrunner of NBC's now-cancelled musical series Smash. To fill in Safran's void, co-executive producer Sara Goodman was promoted to executive producer for the sixth season. Alexandra Patsavas who worked with Schwartz on The O.C. was in charge of the music. Eric Daman was at the head of the costume department; he previously had assisted Patricia Field on Sex and the City.


=== Casting ===
Featuring nine regular speaking roles, the majority of the ensemble cast was assembled from February to April 2007. Leighton Meester and Blake Lively–who started auditioning in December 2006–were the first two actresses to be chosen in February for the lead roles of Blair Waldorf and Serena van der Woodsen, respectively. Penn Badgley, who had previously worked with Stephanie Savage on The Mountain, Taylor Momsen, Chace Crawford, Kelly Rutherford, and Connor Paolo also auditioned successfully and landed roles in the series in March, as did Florencia Lozano who appeared only in the pilot, and was later replaced by Margaret Colin. Badgley at first turned down the part of Dan, as did Lively—who planned to attend college—for the role of Serena. Actors for the roles of Chuck Bass and Rufus Humphrey were found in April when English actor Ed Westwick, and Matthew Settle were cast. Westwick first read for the role of Nate but was then asked to try Chuck. As rumors swirled about the impending cancellation of Veronica Mars, it was revealed at The CW's 2007 Upfronts on May 17, 2007, that Kristen Bell had narrated the pilot, thus making her the title character of another show on the network. Of the casting, Bell said:

I read [the Gossip Girl pilot], and I knew I was sort of old to play any of the kids. I called Dawn Ostroff [...] and said, ""Hey, I did so much narration on Veronica Mars, can I narrate this show?"" [...] It was so clear to me how sassy and catty she needed to be.
Jessica Szohr was signed on to portray the recurring role of Vanessa Abrams and received regular status during the fourteenth episode of the first season. Kaylee DeFer joined the series in the eighteenth episode of the fourth season and was promoted to series regular for the show's fifth season.At the conclusion of the fourth season, Momsen, who went on an indefinite hiatus during the season while retaining regular billing, and Jessica Szohr both left the show. Throughout the series' run, Connor Paolo consistently declined to elevate his recurring role of Eric van der Woodsen to regular status, citing personal reasons for his decision. After becoming a regular on the ABC series Revenge, Paolo confirmed his departure from Gossip Girl in August 2011.As the show progressed, numerous recurring guest stars appeared in the show. Michelle Trachtenberg signed on to portray Georgina Sparks. The role had previously been offered to Mischa Barton who declined the role. Francie Swift and Sam Robards took the parental roles of Anne and Howard Archibald, respectively. Caroline Lagerfelt portrayed Celia ""CeCe"" Rhodes, Serena and Eric's grandmother and Lily's mother. Sebastian Stan made several appearances as Carter Baizen throughout the show's first three seasons.


=== Filming locations ===

Primarily filming in New York, Gossip Girl has been declared by New York Magazine as the ""Most Restauranty Show Since Sex and the City"", citing the pilot episode filming locales such as the Japanese restaurant, Geisha, the Campbell Apartment where Nate and Serena were filmed having sex and the New York Palace Hotel bar Gilt. Other New York City landmarks and well-known establishments were filmed throughout the first season. Victor/Victrola filmed the fictional infamous Chuck Bass burlesque club, Victrola, at The Box Manhattan, a sister club to The Box Soho in London. The fictional Constance Billard-St.Judes School, based on novel writer Cecily Von Ziegesar's alma mater, Nightingale-Bamford used external shots of the Museum of the City of New York.The second season premiered at the Hamptons and began filming in mid-June. The season premiere opening montage showed a scene at Cooper's Beach that was instead filmed in Rockaway Beach followed by an elaborate white party. For the sixth episode of the season, Columbia University was used to film the Yale campus, an episode that followed disappointment from Yale fans due to its erroneous portrayal of the admissions process and reliance on Ivy League university stereotypes. During the season's seventh episode, the Brooklyn Inn was integrated into the show. Remaining true to its New York locations, the show filmed at the Russian Tea Room.The fourth season premiered on September 13, 2010, with the first two episodes filmed in Paris. New York Magazine revealed several locations shot at the French University, La Sorbonne in the Latin District (or Quartier Latin) of Paris on July 5. Other locations include the Musée d'Orsay, the Eiffel Tower, the Gare du Nord, Avenue Montaigne. and Saint-Germain-des-Prés. Columbia University became the primary filming location for the first few episodes of the season following the Paris story arc.The fifth season premiered on September 26, 2011, with the first two episodes filmed in Los Angeles, California.Because of its location in New York, executive producer Stephanie Savage said, ""We were quickly told it would be too expensive, too complicated"" at the beginning of the series. She said that it had been proposed to shoot in a Los Angeles studio that would recreate Central Park, but they eventually filmed the series in New York. Savage explained their choice to film there, ""There's no New York City on TV, or there wasn't when we started making the pilot, except what you could see in the background behind the dead bodies on cop shows. We've never seen the city from the point of view of teenagers. It felt like a world with high stakes for young people."" Schwartz added, ""What's funny about these teenagers is they grew up watching Sex and the City, even though it wasn't about them. And I think they've probably incorporated that into how they mythologize New York. I fought really hard to shoot the show in New York because we want New York to be a character in the show."" Many scenes were filmed in the Empire Hotel on the Upper West Side.


=== Episode format ===
Each episode begins with the home page of the Gossip Girl website and Serena's picture from the pilot episode. Afterward, a recap of events relevant to the upcoming narrative is shown, which ends again with the home page of the website, only this time with a picture from other character(s) with a text about a recent event connected with the picture.
The narrator is Gossip Girl, voiced by actress Kristen Bell. She begins the recap with the sentence, ""Gossip Girl here, your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite,"" and ends the recap with whispered voices saying ""Where has she been?"" and ""Serena."" Then, the voice of Gossip Girl says, ""And who am I? That's one secret I'll never tell! You know you love me... XOXO, Gossip Girl.""
During each episode, there is always a social event taking place, whether small or large. Joshua Safran explained, ""We structure it [the show] so that every week, the episode leads to an event. I feel like it is much like a procedural.""


=== Episode titles ===
All of the episodes' titles are based on the name of a film or a novel. For example, episode ""The Wild Brunch"" evokes western film The Wild Bunch and ""Seventeen Candles"" Sixteen Candles. Episode ""All About My Brother"" refers to Pedro Almodóvar's All About My Mother while ""Pret-a-Poor-J"" came from Prêt-à-Porter. ""There Might Be Blood"" took its title from 2007 film There Will Be Blood. ""The Serena Also Rises"" was titled after novel The Sun Also Rises. The fifth-season episode ""The Big Sleep No More"" was named for the film The Big Sleep and the New York-based production Sleep No More. Episode ""Easy J"" was titled after Emma Stone's hit movie Easy A. Episode ""The Age of Dissonance"", which was titled after Edith Wharton's novel The Age of Innocence, saw a high school production of the novel taking place, and ""The Blair Bitch Project"" was named after The Blair Witch Project. ""Victor, Victrola"" is named after the British-American musical comedy Victor/Victoria. ""Bad News Blair"" was named after the 1976 movie The Bad News Bears.
Joshua Safran said, ""we draw from classic works like Les Liaisons Dangereuses and The Great Gatsby as much as we do from pop culture.""


=== Product placement ===
Gossip Girl is known for its product placement. The show had a contract with Verizon Wireless for its first five seasons; all the characters were seen with phones chosen by the brand until the deal ended by the sixth season. During their contract, Verizon Wireless offered exclusive Gossip Girl content and created a website where ringtones of the songs featured on the show could be downloaded. Barbra Robin, The CW's senior vice president of Integrated Marketing, stated: ""It was really about showing features on a device. [...] Initially, it was just a wireless phone, but eventually that became a smartphone, a tablet, all these other types of technology that took them through their day and showed how they used it to get from one place to the next.""In mid-2008, executives of VitaminWater approached The CW for a placement deal. During the second season, the drinks were mentioned several times in dialogues. The partnership helped pay the costs of shooting on location in the Hamptons. An HP TouchPad was prominently displayed in an episode of the sixth season. According to OneNewsNow.com, other sponsors have included Procter & Gamble, L'Oreal, Target and Johnson & Johnson, which allowed the series to earn $28.2 million in advertising revenue in 2007.

== Reception ==


=== Critical response ===

Gossip Girl initially received positive reviews. Due to the show's pedigree as an adaptation of The New York Times bestselling novel series, the show was considered to be one of the more anticipated new shows of the 2007–2008 television season. An August 2007 survey by OTX, a global media research and consulting firm, placed the show on the list of top ten new shows that viewers were aware of. Though the pilot was the recipient of many positive reviews from publications such as Variety, The Washington Post, San Francisco Chronicle and the Boston Globe, other reviewers described it as a guilty pleasure rather than an hour's worth of must-watch television. Metacritic gave it a score of 59, based on the reviews of 40 different publications.Toward the conclusion of the first season, Janet Malcolm of The New Yorker criticized the show for its deviations from the novels. She has stated that the series was ""related to the original only in the names and outlines of the characters"". She further asserted that, ""Without von Ziegesar's fast, mocking commentary to propel them, the TV episodes are sluggish and crass—a move from Barneys to Kmart."" However, author Cecily von Ziegesar has expressed support for the show, noting that all of her major plot points were present in the pilot.As the show continued its first season, the response became considerably more positive, and by the second season critical response was favorable. Metacritic gave the new season an improved score of 71. ""Summer's been good to this girl,"" claimed Entertainment Weekly, who awarded the series its highest grade of ""A"". The New York Daily News claimed the show had found its footing by stating ""It knows exactly what it wants and needs its new hybrid product to be. The hockey fights video of teen romance drama."" Gossip Girl was designated the ""Greatest Teen Drama of All Time"" by New York magazine. The magazine wrote, ""the show has resurrected the potential for scripted dramas to be effective social satire—to present a world more accurately than a ""reality"" program can. Gossip Girl presents a wealth-eye view of the city, but because it is a cartoon we can laugh along with the conspicuousness of the consumption.""The Christian Parents Television Council has shown particular criticism of the series, especially with its ""OMFG"" ad campaign from April 2008. It also named the episode ""Victor/Victrola"" the worst television program of the week in which the episode originally was broadcast. Quotes from the Parents Television Council review, as well as negative quotes from the San Diego Union-Tribune, New York Post and the Boston Herald, were used on various advertisements for the second season. The Hartford Courant chronicled a variety of negative responses to the ads. The ads included quotes like ""Every Parent's Nightmare"", ""Mind-Blowingly Inappropriate"" and ""A Nasty Piece of Work"" in what appears to be an effort to continue the ""rebellious teen"" style of the show.With the approach of the fifth season, New York Magazine reviewed the life expectancy of the show, noting its waning cultural relevancy despite the growing prominence of its actors, and the loss of its status as The CW's No.1 show, having been beaten out in terms of ratings by other shows of the network like Supernatural and 90210. ""The series itself hasn't quite kept up, even if its plotting is as juicy and lunatic as ever."" and that ""The cast would all rather be making movies, while the showrunners are focusing on launching new projects via their nascent Fake Empire production company (including CW newcomer Hart of Dixie). Barring an unexpected brand reboot or another stab at a spinoff, we're afraid the end is near. XOXO."" AOL TV ranked Gossip Girl the 20th Best School Show of All Time and the 4th TV's Biggest Guilty Pleasure. The show was declared the tenth highest rated show for the first ten years of IMDb.com Pro (2002–2012).There was much controversy around Dan being revealed as Gossip Girl in the season finale. Dan had always struggled to be an insider among the Upper East Side and had supposedly created Gossip Girl to gain more power and had been the one ""pulling the strings the whole time,"" as mentioned by Serena in the finale. However, there was much speculation and controversy regarding this decision. Penn Badgley, who played Dan, stated in an interview that he himself found it funny that the writers had decided to make him be Gossip Girl and that he did not know about the reveal before shooting the series finale. Badgley cited the numerous instances of Dan appearing to be shocked by a Gossip Girl blast while alone, which would not make sense if Dan had been the one posting on Gossip Girl.


=== Cultural influence ===
CW executive Dawn Ostroff later compared Gossip Girl's role as the show that defined its network to House of Cards for Netflix. Its television audience was never very large, but the show was influential on culture; Savage recalled that the crew likened working on it to working for a lifestyle magazine. Bell stated, ""[Schwartz and Savage] were spearheading: 'What if the Internet is just a place to judge people? What if that's what it turns into?' And they turned out to be Nostradamus.""A hairstylist for the show compared media interest in Lively's hair to that for Jennifer Aniston's ""The Rachel"". In 2008, The New York Times reported the show has had a profound impact on retail, saying Gossip Girl is probably ""the first [show] to have been conceived, in part, as a fashion marketing vehicle"". While it has had middling success in terms of ratings, it ""may well be the biggest influence in the youth culture market"", said a trendspotter. However, for Maheen Humayun of The Tempest, the show emphasized toxic cultural traits, like rape culture, that ""messed up a whole generation."" According to Zoe Fox of Mashable, the show popularized social media networks and mobile communication, becoming ""a pioneer in its use of mobile"". In 2008, New York Magazine named the series as ""Best Show Ever"". In 2009, Rolling Stone named the series as ""TV's Hottest Show"".On January 26, 2012, in honor of the series' 100th episode, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg visited the set and proclaimed the date Gossip Girl Day, citing the show's cultural influence and impact on the economy of the city. ""Gossip Girl has made New York a central character. While Gossip Girl is drawing fans in with its plot twists, the show also attracts many of them to visit New York, contributing to our incredible 50.5 million visitors last year.

Gossip Girl was very influential on fashion for teenage and young adult women. The show was intended in part as a way for fashion companies to market their products. Some brands paid a fee, and the show's Web site provided referral links so viewers could purchase items they saw on television. In 2009, Anna Sui created a line inspired by Gossip Girl. Daman, who based his costumes on what Manhattan private-school students wore,, said that by the sixth season the show was ""getting one-of-a-kind couture from Paris"", because ""they wanted their wares on Blake Lively"".On September 16, 2011, it was announced that Warner Bros. and label Romeo & Juliet Couture had partnered to create Gossip Girl's official clothing line inspired by lead characters Serena van der Woodsen and Blair Waldorf. The launch of the fashion line took place on September 26, 2011, the same day as the premiere of the fifth season.Cosmetics online retailer Birchbox and Gossip Girl have teamed up to create a special Birchbox edition filled with beauty products inspired by the show. The products were chosen by Gossip Girl's makeup department head, Amy Tagliamonti, and hair department head, Jennifer Johnson.


== International adaptations ==
Gossip Girl spawned several adaptations in other countries. The Turkish adaptation is known as Little Secrets (Küçük Sırlar). Little Secrets contains numerous differences from the original TV series. Blair Waldorf is not present. Chuck has been rewritten, with Serena and later Chuck's stepsister Ayşegül, a character present only in the Turkish version, being love interests. Arzu is another character unique to Little Secrets.On March 5, 2012, it was reported that Warner Bros. International Television and Metan Development Group would produce a Chinese teen drama series called China Girl inspired by Gossip Girl. Production was set to start in June 2012 with the show airing in November. The show was to follow the lives of students at a university instead of a high school. No news of the actual broadcast followed.
A Mexican version of the series was produced by Mexican producer Pedro Torres as Gossip Girl: Acapulco. The show stars Sofía Sisniega, Oka Giner, Jon Ecker, Vadhir Derbez, Diego Amozurrutia, and Macarena Achaga.

== Sequel ==

A sequel to the series was released on WarnerMedia's streaming service HBO Max. The new series received an initial 10-episode order and picks up nine years after the original Gossip Girl site went dark, as a new generation of private school teens are introduced to the watchful eye of Gossip Girl. These new characters also attend the Upper East Side prep school Constance Billard, as did the characters of the original series. Josh Schwartz confirmed the new series would be a continuation rather than a reboot. Leighton Meester, the actress who played Blair Waldorf, confirmed on Good Morning America that she would not be a part of the sequel. When asked, Meester answered, ""I was not asked to be on it, so no.""

== Aspetuck Historic District ==
The Aspetuck Historic District is a historic district that preserves part of the historic village. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.  It occupies about 80 acres (32 ha) on the banks of the Aspetuck River and includes the oldest section of Easton.  The 22 houses in the historic district date from 1750 to 1850. Some structures in the district are examples of Colonial Revival architecture.  The district is considered significant for being a ""Connecticut farming community that hasn't seen much change"" and the home of Helen Keller in her later years. Helen Keller, who was blind and deaf, often walked through the neighborhood by herself, using as her guide a fence that extended down to the Aspetuck River.The historic district is defined to ""exclude excessive back acreage"" and also ""the district stops short of the historical extent of the community in order to exclude an area where the majority of buildings would be noncontributing due to alterations or recent origin."": 19 The district ""is significant because it embodies the distinctive architectural and cultural-landscape characteristics of a farming community from the late colonial and early national periods.... The widely spaced distribution of houses, most accompanied by a barn and all with ample yards that once served as pasture, field or garden recalls the appearance of an inland Connecticut farming community when agriculture was the basis of the local economy.  The predominant type of building in the district—the traditional center-chimney, gable-roofed dwelling—is also characteristic of Connecticut farming communities of the late 18th and early 19th centuries...."": 12 The district is significant because a house on Redding ""was the long-time home of Helen Keller, who lost her hearing and sight at an early age, and whose long struggle to overcome these handicaps has provided inspiration to millions...."": 12 

Significant structures in the district include:

Orando Perry House, 1840, which ""displays the impact of Greek Revival architecture house with in its small porch with Doric columns and flush-boarded pediment""
Bradley House, 7 Old Redding Road
Helen Keller House, 1946, 163 Redding Road, ""a true Colonial Revival dwelling, built in the 20th century after late 18th-century precedents, rather than the 20th-century modification of an earlier house"": 5   It has a denticular cornice and a ""pedimented entry shelter on Tuscan columns"", among other details.: 9 
Peter Williams House, 1810, 65 Redding Road
David Bradley House, 1790, 135 Redding Road
a bridge (Connecticut Dept. of Transportation Bridge #4933), a reinforced concrete arch bridge with cobblestone-faced spandrels and parapets, from 1941
a dam, a rubble-stone dam from mid-19th century at the site of the Orando Perry grist mill

It is located in Southwestern Albania along the Albanian Ionian Sea Coast, whereas the Strait of Otranto separates it from Italy. The Strait of Mezokanal separates the peninsula from Sazan Island, while in the southeast stretches the Bay of Vlorë. Its name “Karaburun” derives from Turkish for ""black cape"". In classical antiquity, its name was the ""Akrokeraunian Peninsula"" (Ακροκεραύνιο ακρωτήριο), whose name was derived from the eponymous Akrokeraunian mountains;this is because in terms of geology, the Rrëza e Kanalit on the peninsula represent the continuation of said mountains, which are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that extends parallel to the Ionian Sea. Karaburun peninsula is sometimes called Ceraunian Peninsula due to the name of the mountain range. Created during the mesozoic era of the cretaceous and paleogene period, the crests of the mountain range form a northwest-southeast line with a series of distinct peaks along its irregular structure that are broken apart by steep and unequally slopes. The highest peaks are namely, the Maja Çaderës, Maja e Flamurit, Maja e Koretës and Maja e Ilqes.
The western section comprises a rough relief and is dotted with sandy and rocky beaches, sea caves, steep cliffs and several bays amongst them Cave of Haxhi Ali, Cape of Gjuhëz, Bay of Skaloma, Bay of Arushë, Bay of Dafinë, and most notably Bay of Grama, where ships and vessels anchored during classical antiquity. On the high and steep rock faces of the bay, which served also as a marble quarry, there are hundreds of rock inscriptions dating back to the 4th century BC.Under the Köppen climate classification, the peninsula experiences a mediterranean climate with hot summers and generally warm to cool, dry winters. The ideal climate and contrasting landscapes located at the sea have favored the development of a vast array of habitats which in turn are home to a diverse wildlife. The fauna is represented by several threatened and endangered species such as the loggerhead and green sea turtle but also the mediterranean monk seal, the rarest seal species in the world.The landmass of the peninsula is designated as nature reserve, while the shoreline and its surrounding sea waters are part of the marine park. In 2014, the Regina Blu ferry was established by a Radhime-based hotel owner making trips between the peninsula and the island of Sazan, while stopping along the secluded beaches.The peninsula belongs to the Sazan Zone that is a constituent of the Albanides tectonic unit. Albanides form the link between Dinarides and Hellenides orogenic belts. They are considered allocthonous and mobilist theories deduce they come from the east. These formations have been continuously under the effect of Karst and are exploited as marble (metamorphosed limestone) since antiquity. The widespread Karst topography is responsible for the absence of potable water and thus the absence of any population on the peninsula. Despite the dry surface and upper soil layers, there are several water sources that pour deep directly into the sea. The geological evolution has formed also capes such as Galloveci cape and Kepi i Gjuhëzës, as well as a total number of 20 caves along the whole coast.","The Karaburun Peninsula (Albanian: Gadishulli i Karaburunit) is a peninsula of the Mediterranean Sea located in Southern and Southeastern Europe, which is almost completely surrounded by both the Adriatic Sea to the north and the Ionian Sea to the south.

The series is released only on the Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS. 
Originally, the game was planned to link the story with the Success Mode storyline in the main (Pawapuro) series.

However, the series now departs from the world of Pawapuro series and forms independent storylines. Since the 8th iteration, Konami used Baseball variety instead of Sport/Simulation as a game genre. Instead of baseball, the portion in Success Mode were much larger than the main series.


== Gameplay ==
Although the game nearly retains everything, including the feature of Power Pro series mascot (The Pawapurokun: a Rayman like character without face parts (other than eyes) and have its legs detached from the rest of its body) using nearly the same game system as the main series, the Power Pro Kun Pocket series is completely different from its main series (Power Pro Series) in other aspects. It uses a more simple system in baseball than their main series. Many features outside the Success Mode were removed from the series, however, features related to Success Mode is increased.
As a feature of the whole Power Pro Series, passwords produced in the Pawapoke series can be transferred to Nintendo consoles' Power Pro Series for playing, but the ability may be weakened a lot.


=== Differences between Pawapuro and Pawapoke series ===
Here are some of the major differences between the two series:


==== For baseball ====
There are no real ballparks included, other than Koshien Stadium.
Farm team players are not included in the series. Individual default tactics towards team and players are not available.
No coaches, managers, player flows and growth in pennant mode.
Card Baseball can be played instead since the eight game (Introduced by spin-off Power Pro Kun Pocket Dash)


==== For abilities ====
Existence of Super Ability, which are stronger than usual abilities.
Changes of explanation, and effects of some abilities.
Name changes for some abilities, abilities in Power Pro series with the suffix 2 becomes X (△ for 10), 4 becomes ○ and 5 becomes ◎.


==== For game modes ====
Money system was introduced to buy expansion teams, mini games, or some other features (similarly to MLB Power Pros).
Mini games are included in nearly every series. Some can be played upon certain conditions, but most needed to be obtained by Success Mode.


== The Success Mode in Power Pro Kun Pocket series ==
Other than the first game (one success mode), and Koshien (does not feature any success mode), all other Power Pro Kun Pocket series titles features at least two different success modes, which called ""Outer-Success"" and ""Inner-Success"". Unlike the Power Pro series, this series did not follow storyline with realism, and many fantasy elements were mixed into the series. The series was greatly influenced by Tokimeki Memorial series, which was the original success mode in power pro series intends to, even Konami itself admit the series becomes ""a Gal-game with baseball contents"", making them changed its genre to ""Baseball Variety"".
Like the Power Pro's setting, fictional pro teams exists in the series as well, but it is completely different teams since the setting has been developing on its own now.


=== Super Ability ===
There exist 10 rare abilities collectively called Super Ability, which can give a great increase to statistics (can exceed limit) or have more negative effects towards opponent players. Pitcher and fielders have a separate 5-set ability and no one can hold more than one Super Abilities. Some Super Abilities will cancel out other Super Abilities in play. Such abilities will not be kept when the player is transferred to the Power Pro series.
The only way to obtain the Super Abilities is playing in Success Mode. In ""Outer-Success"", players can obtain Super Abilities by finishing the girl's endings, which each of them keep two (one each for pitcher and fielder) Super Abilities. However, in each of the series there exist a wild-card girl character, who can give any Super Abilities by players' choice, but usually it needs tougher requirements.

== History ==
According to its website, Quryna was first published on 20 August 2007 as a limited print newspaper and grew to a 32-page media. It is currently published online and in print nationally on Mondays. According to The Lede blog, Quryna was named after the ancient Greek colony Cyrene, Libya. The name was changed to Yosberides on 3 March 2011, but was later changed back.
It was part of the Al-Ghad Media Corporation owned by Muammar Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam until the state took it over. Its reporting then was sympathetic to Gaddafi. When Gaddafi lost control of Benghazi in early 2011, it began to report openly and claimed to be impartial to either side of the protests. Reports, however, emerged that the paper was seized by protesters. The web site of the newspaper was registered on 6 March 2011, and the head of the main page shows the flag of the Libyan Republic, used first by the rebels and now officially as the flag of the state.

The episodes broadcast on CBS were also carried on six stations of the Alaska Broadcasting System.


== Origin ==
Charlie Wild, Private Detective replaced The Adventures of Sam Spade on the air. The change followed the listing of Sam Spade's star (Howard Duff) and creator (Dashiell Hammett) in the anti-Communist tract Red Channels.
Radio historian John Dunning wrote that the association of the two names with Communist activities was ""making Spade sponsor Wildroot Cream-Oil increasingly unhappy."" However, representatives of both the Wildroot company and the advertising agency that had the account denied that the cancellation of Sam Spade was related to the stir caused by Red Channels. They said that the sponsor wanted a program with a lower budget on radio so that the money saved could be used for television.In either case, the last Spade episode aired on September 17, 1950, and the first Wild episode was heard on September 24, 1950. Duff provided a transition between the two programs by appearing as Spade on the first episode of the new series with what Dunning called ""a vocal telegram, wishing the new hero well.""


== Premise ==
Private investigator Charlie Wild had his headquarters in New York City. Leon Morse wrote in a review in the trade publication Billboard that the program had ""tough talk, vivid similies, a hard-guy hero and fantastic descriptions of females.""


== Personnel ==
George Petrie played Wild in the NBC episodes. Kevin O'Morrison replaced Petrie when the program went to CBS, and John McQuade replaced O'Morrison on March 25, 1951. Peter Hobbs portrayed McCoy, Wild's assistant.The producers were Edwin Marshall and Lawrence White; the directors, Carlo D'Angelo and Stanley Niss; the writer, Peter Barry; the announcer, William Rogers; and the musical director, Charles Sherrill.

Lobaria,"[""Articles with 'species' microformats"", 'Articles with short description', 'Lichens', 'Lobaria', 'Peltigerales genera', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'Taxa described in 1791', 'Taxa named by Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber']","Lobaria is a genus of foliose lichens, formerly classified in the family Lobariaceae, but now placed in the Peltigeraceae. They are commonly known as ""lung wort"" or ""lungmoss"" as their physical shape somewhat resembles a lung, and their ecological niche is similar to that of moss.
Lobaria are unusual in that they have a three-part symbiosis, containing a fungus, and an alga (as other lichens do), but also a cyanobacterium that fixes nitrogen.","Lobaria is a genus of foliose lichens, formerly classified in the family Lobariaceae, but now placed in the Peltigeraceae.

Lobaria are unusual in that they have a three-part symbiosis, containing a fungus, and an alga (as other lichens do), but also a cyanobacterium that fixes nitrogen.


== Taxonomy ==
Lobaria was originally described as a section of the eponymous genus Lichen by German naturalist Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1786. It was proposed as a genus by Georg Franz Hoffmann in 1796. The establishment of Lobaria remained uncertain until Edvard Vainio also described it. He divided the genus into two sections based on different morphologies of the mature spore: Lobaria and Ricasolia. In 2013, the concept of family Lobariaceae was revised with the help of molecular phylogenetics, and, in addition to the creation of several new genera, Ricasolia was promoted to generic status. The family Lobariaceae was synonymized with the Peltigeraceae in 2018.


== Ecology ==
Lichenicolous fungi that have been found growing on Lobaria species include Stigmidium lobariae, Calycina alstrupii, and Abrothallus halei.A Lobaria-associated actinobacterium, Subtercola lobariae, was isolated from L. retigera collected from the Jiaozi Snow Mountain in Yunnan Province, China. About a third of the bacteria found colonizing the thallus surface of Lobaria pulmonaria were found to belong to the Rhizobiales. This order of bacteria is well-known in their role as beneficial partners in plant-microbe interactions. Advantages conferred by the presence of the bacteria include auxin and vitamin production, nitrogen fixation, and stress protection. Although the bacteria were most prevalent on the thallus surface, they were shown to be able to penetrate  into the interhyphal gelatinous matrix of the upper lichen cortical layer. Occasionally, some bacteria colonize the interior of the fungal hyphae.Hydration traits determine much of a lichen's distribution pattern along a climatic gradient. A study demonstrated that Lobaria amplissima thalli with external cephalodia need more rain than thalli without, consistent with reports of decreasing frequency of external cephalodia from wet to drier climates.A study using ecological niche modelling of occurrence data of three Lobaria species found in Italy predicts that climate change will impact their distribution range across the country and that there is a high extinction risk resulting from reduction of their range.


== Evolutionary history ==
A fossil impression found in a 12–24 Myr-old Miocene deposit from Trinity County in northern California has strong similarities to extant species of Lobaria, particularly L. pulmonaria and other species with reticulated edges, including L. anomala and L. retigera. Using a molecular clock-calibrated phylogeny to obtain a time estimate for Lobaria yielded a stem age (the time that that clade descended from a common ancestor with its sister clade) of nearly 30 Mya. The evidence suggests that the paleoclimate and the closing or opening of the Bering Strait played a significant role in determining the distribution of most Lobaria species.

== Chemistry ==
Retigeranic acid is a sesterterpene compound isolated from Lobaria retigera. The ethyl acetate extract of Lobaria orientalis collected in Central Vietnam led to the isolation of new β-orcinol depsidones, lobarientalones A and B, and several diphenyl ethers, lobariethers A–E.

== Plot ==
The novel opens with the description of one of the nightmares, which crowd the nights of Stefano Illuminati, the main character. The nightmares had begun from an episode of 1943. Stefano, who was 13 years old and lived in the Langhe, occupied by the Nazis, had killed as a joke a German man with a revolver stolen to his father, that was a fascist colonel. Then he had hidden the body, not saying anything to anybody, not even to his trusted friend Francesco, with whom he had talked about a similar project. 
Twenty years later, Stefano lives in Rome; he hasn't returned to his family in Piedmont for many years. Coming from a difficult year, disappointed, he decides to go on a journey to the Langhe, to make order in his life. He is followed by Laura, named as Lu, who was his mistress. Lu and Stefano had been closely to have a child, but they had renounced and their relationship had become a simple friendship, even if Lu is haunted by the thought of her missed motherhood.
During the slow voyage, with stages Pisa, Bolsena, Piacenza and Campione d'Italia before arriving in Piedmont, Stefano recurs his life. Stefano's grandfather was a great one for parties, woman and food; antifascist, he is dead just after the Italy's join in the Second World War. In a big house in the Piedmontese countryside Stefano spent the summer playing with his best friend Francesco, son of a farmer. Doro, who takes care about fields and barns, has communist sympathies; he will die thrown in a well, desperate for the death of a pig, who was his economical hope during the period of the nazi's occupation.
Stefano's father, Giacomo Illuminati, husband of a grandfather's daughter, is an austere soldier, army's colonel, that tries to instill in Stefano the discipline, obliging him to answer ""comandi"" to every calling. Convinced supporter of the fascist regime, the colonel performs service in Piacenza, where Stefano and his mother spent the winter and where Stefano has to participate as a balilla to the youth rallies.
The colonel renounces to participate to military expeditions to stay close to his family and this causes him great moan. His beliefs fall after the 1943 armistice: forced to escape from Piacenza to break out from Germans, he arrives in the Langhe, where Stefano and his mother had been living since a long time: he is unrecognizable, turned into his own shadow, with a long beard and a wasted uniform, that was unthinkable.
The killing's episode of a German happen during the following months. At the beginning of 1944 Stefano, dizzy by the facts, wants to do something, and, 14 years old, he decides to escape. In Milan he managed to make himself look older and in a barrack of the fascist Guardia Repubblicana give him a warrant and send him to La Spezia, where he's recruited in the Decima Mas. In the following months the oldest fellow soldiers wait the occasion to do something in vain. Stefano escapes and returns home when two marines older than him unsuccessfully try to introduce him in a brothel.
In Piedmont, there is the rapprochement with Francesco, and also his join to the partisan fight. Stefano is in Turin on the Liberation day (25 April). In the following years Stefano is involved in left wing movements, then he moved to Rome, where he starts to work in an office. The colonel remains alone in the Langhe house, with the company of the faithful housewife Caterina, always plunged in empty studies, without seeing Stefano for many years.
When Stefano and Lu arrive at colonel's house, the relationship between father and son is difficult and superficial , but the strictness of the colonel is only a mask. When he talks with Lu, the colonel asks constantly of Stefano, he wants to know about his life and his success. Stefano, before leaving, meets again Francesco, distrusted from the youth enthusiasms, convinced not to have succeeded to realise what he fought for. The voyage seems to have restored him because he concludes that memories won't be abandoned and that we will be condemned only if the readers could refuse to express the secret goodness that wait us every morning.

It is referred to as South Soko Island in some media articles.


== Geography ==
With an area of 1.2 km², Tai A Chau is the largest of the Soko Islands. It is located 4.5 km to the south of Lantau Island and about 2 km north of the boundary of the Hong Kong territorial waters. The island has small hills with heights ranging from 85m to 154m. Its coastline is mainly steeply sloped and rocky in nature.


== History ==
There were historically two villages on the island: Ha Tsuen and Sheung Tsuen on the west and south sides of the island. The villagers left in the 1980s, when a detention camp for Vietnamese refugees was built. In 1937, Walter Schofield, then a Cadet Officer in the Hong Kong Civil Service, wrote ""There is a shrimp paste factory here which exports to Europe and America"". Tai A Chau Detention Centre was home to thousands of Vietnamese refugees from 1991 to 1996. It once held a peak population of almost 9,700 in November 1991. After the announcement of the closure of Tai A Chau refugee facility on 10 June 1996, the transfer of the remaining Vietnamese refugees took place on 10 consecutive days from 16 to 25 September 1996. Each day, one ferry loaded with luggage, and two ferries loaded with a total of about 550 Vietnamese refugees departed Tai A Chau for HMS Tamar naval base at Stonecutters Island. They were then moved to the notorious Whitehead Detention Centre in Wu Kai Sha, before immigrating to the US under their “Resettlement Opportunity for Vietnamese Returnees Scheme”. This ensured the centre was closed just prior to the handover in 1997 and all the building structures were demolished.


== Features ==
The island has a temple dedicated to Tin Hau and seven earth shrines.Two helicopter landing pads and a small jetty remain from the island's former detention centre.

== History ==


=== Early history of the site ===
Archaeological excavations in the 1920s produced evidence which suggests a hill fort was built on the headland where the castle now stands. Finds were dated to between 900–500 BC, part of the late Bronze Age/early Iron Age. Among finds dating back about 3,000 years, a Bronze Age sword, thought to have been a ritual offering, is on display in the castle exhibition.A 4th-century Roman signal station, one of several on the Yorkshire coast, was built on the headland at the cliff top. The station was to warn of approaching hostile vessels, and took advantage of a natural source of fresh water which became known as the ""Well of Our Lady"". The remains of the signal tower were excavated in the 1920s revealing it to be square in plan around a small courtyard. It measured about 33 metres across and was built of wood on stone foundations with a gatehouse and an outer ditch.The Anglo-Saxons built a chapel on the station site around the year 1000, the remains of which are still visible. This is reputed to have been destroyed during the invasion of Harald Hardrada in 1066.  A much later Icelandic poem claims that a Viking settlement around the harbour was burnt down in 1066 by Hardrada's forces, who built a large bonfire on the headland to supply burning brands to hurl at the villagers below. However, there is no archaeological evidence of such an event, nor any of the Viking presence. The first evidence of the harbour settlement coincides with the establishment of the stone castle around 1157–1164. This grew from a small settlement around a wooden fortress which the stone castle replaced.


=== Development and decline ===
William le Gros, Count of Aumale, a powerful Anglo-Norman baron and grand-nephew of William the Conqueror, built a wooden fortification after his receipt of the Earldom of York, from King Stephen in 1138, granted as reward for his victory at the Battle of the Standard. Aumale may have re-founded the town of ""Scardeburg"", though there is little evidence of this. As with other castles, there would have been at least a small settlement nearby. Some information on the establishment of the castle has survived in the chronicle of William of Newburgh, a monk who in the 1190s wrote about its foundation. The castle had a gate tower, curtain wall, dry moat and chapel. This motte and bailey castle subsequently disappeared, with only the small, raised mound of the motte visible in the inner bailey today.

The fate of the original fortifications is unclear. Henry II ordered that all royal castles be returned to the Crown. He had a policy of destroying adulterine castles, built without royal permission, during Stephen's chaotic reign. Initially, Aumale resisted the call to hand over Scarborough, which he had built on a royal manor, until Henry's forces arrived at York. The wooden castle vanished – William of Newburgh, writing near the time, claimed that the structure had decayed through age and the elements, battered beyond repair on the windswept headland. Later interpretations view this as implausible and argue that Henry wanted to stamp his mark on Scarborough, by demolishing William's fort and creating a much stronger stone complex.From about 1157, Henry II rebuilt the castle using stone. Much of the building work occurred between 1159 and 1169, when the three-storey keep was built and a stone wall replaced the wooden palisade protecting the inner bailey. By the end of Henry's reign in 1189, a total of £682, 15 shillings and threepence had been spent on the castle, of which £532 was spent between 1157 and 1164. Henry's average annual income during his reign was about £10,000. The castle became a strategic northern stronghold for The Crown. Henry II granted the town that had grown up beneath the fortress, the title of Royal Borough.
While Richard I (reigned 1189–1199) had spent nothing on the castle, his brother King John (reigned 1199–1216) ensured that it was a comfortable residence for himself and his retinue. John's rule was strongly opposed by the northern barons, so the castle at Scarborough was fortified as a strategic stronghold. John visited the castle four times during his reign, and spent a considerable sum on the castle. He built the curtain wall on the west and south sides during 1202–1212, and a new hall called the ""King's Chambers"", later Mosdale Hall. In total, John spent £2,291, three shillings and fourpence on the castle. This included £780 that was earmarked for repairing the roof of the keep in 1211–1212; John spent more on the castle than any other monarch. The Pipe Rolls, records of royal expenditure, show that John spent over £17,000 on 95 castles during his reign spread, and Scarborough received the most investment.Improvements continued under Henry III (reigned 1216–1272). By this time, Scarborough was a thriving port, and though he never visited the castle, Henry spent a considerable sum on its upkeep. Around 1240–1250, he installed a new barbican consisting of two towers flanking the gateway, with another two towers protecting the approach. These were completed in 1343, although have been much-modified since. At this time, the castle was a powerful base which an unscrupulous governor could abuse: Geoffrey de Neville, who was governor for 20 years in the 13th century, used the garrison to seize port goods. Since governors were not required to reside in the castle, they often pocketed funds rather than used them for repairs. By the mid-to-late 13th century, the defences were decaying, floorboards rotted, roof tiles were missing and armouries bare of weaponry. Corruption continued among the castle's custodians, who acted with impunity as the castle was outside the jurisdiction of the borough. In the 1270s, governor William de Percy blocked the main road into Scarborough and imposed illegal tolls.Despite its decline, in 1265 the castle was committed to Prince Edward, later Edward I (reigned 1272–1307), who held court there in 1275 and 1280. In 1295, hostages from his campaigns to subjugate Wales were held at the castle.


=== Piers Gaveston besieged, 1312 ===
Henry de Percy, who occupied the castle from 1308, had a bakehouse, brewhouse and kitchens built in the inner bailey. and the castle was once again made into a major fortification. Edward II (reigned 1307–1327) imprisoned some of his Scottish enemies there in 1311. In 1312 he gave Isabella de Vesci the castles of Bamburgh and Scarborough. The castle was considered to be the natural place for the king's favourite knight, the Gascon Piers Gaveston, to seek sanctuary when pursued by the barons who had imposed the Ordinances of 1311. The Ordinances were imposed to curb the King's power, and the barons saw Gaveston as a threat to their interests. Sir Robert Felton was governor of Scarborough Castle in 1311 and was slain at Stirling in 1314. In April 1312, Edward made Gaveston the governor of Scarborough Castle, but his tenure would be brief. In May, the Earls of Pembroke and Warenne, together with Henry de Percy, besieged and took the castle. Despite its strong defences, it fell quickly due to lack of provisions. Gaveston was promised safe escort from the castle, but on the journey south was captured by the Earl of Warwick and killed. Scarborough fared little better; Edward punished the town for not supporting Gaveston by revoking its royal privileges and placing it under the direct rule of appointed governors.


=== Further assaults and decay, 1318–1635 ===
At the time of the Hundred Years War (1337–1453), Scarborough was an important port for the wool trade, so was attacked several times by enemy forces. With rumours of a French invasion, a 1393 inquiry into the state of the castle led to repairs being carried out in 1396 and 1400. Henry VI (reigned 1422–1461; 1470–1471) ordered major repairs between 1424 and 1429. Richard III (reigned 1483–1485) was the last monarch to enter its grounds. He resided at the castle in 1484 while forming a fleet to fight the Tudors, a struggle he lost along with his life the following year.After assaults by forces from France and Scotland in the early 16th century, in 1536 Robert Aske unsuccessfully tried to take the castle during the Pilgrimage of Grace, a revolt against the Dissolution of the Monasteries and Henry VIII's (reigned 1509–1547) break with the Roman Catholic Church. Repairs were made in 1537, and in 1538 some of the lead of the towers was used by the keeper, Sir Ralph Eure (Evers), to make a brewing vessel; Eure reported that some of the walls had fallen down. In 1557, forces loyal to Thomas Wyatt the younger, who opposed Mary I (reigned 1553–1558) and Catholicism, took the castle by entering disguised as peasants. Their leader, Thomas Stafford, held the castle for three days, and was subsequently executed for high treason on Tower Hill.


=== Civil War sieges, 1642–1648 ===

In September 1642, at the outbreak of the English Civil War (1642–1651), Sir Hugh Cholmley occupied the castle as a Parliamentarian loyal to Oliver Cromwell but swapped sides in March 1643. The castle was refortified on Cholmley's orders, including the establishment of the South Steel Battery for artillery. After Cholmeley's defection, the castle, with its garrison of 700 Royalist soldiers, the town and its strategic supply port were on the side of Charles I. (reigned 1625–1649)  The Parliamentarians saw Scarborough as a valuable Royalist target because it was the only port not under their dominion.On 18 February 1645, Sir John Meldrum took the town from the Royalists, cutting off any escape routes by land or sea and delivering the port for Parliament. The same day, Cholmley retreated into the castle and refused to give in, so the Parliamentarians prepared for what would be a five-month siege – one of the most bloody of the Civil War, with almost continuous fighting. The Parliamentary forces set up what was then the largest cannon in the country, the Cannon Royal, in the 12th-century St. Mary's Church below the castle, and proceeded to fire 56–65 pounds (25–29 kg) cannonballs that pounded the castle's defences. In turn, the church was extensively damaged over the three days of fighting. The bombardment partially destroyed the castle keep, but the outer walls were not breached. The Parliamentary forces were unable to take the castle and there followed a period of particularly bloody hand-to-hand fighting around the barbican gateway in which Sir John Meldrum was killed.By July the tide was turning in the Parliamentarians' favour: bombardment, scurvy, lack of water, perhaps a shortage of gunpowder and the threat of starvation and only 25 men fit to fight meant that the castle surrendered on 25 July 1645. Only about half of the original 500 defenders emerged alive. Subsequently the castle was repaired and rearmed for Parliament with a company of 160. Matthew Boynton, the castle's new governor, declared for the king on 27 July 1648 when the soldiers went unpaid. This led to a second siege which brought the castle back under Parliamentary control on 19 December, when the garrison was defeated as much by the oncoming winter as by the Parliamentary forces. The castle changed hands seven times between 1642 and 1648. The castle was later used as a prison for those who were deemed to be enemies of the Commonwealth of England, the country's brief period of republicanism; the shell of the keep survives, minus the west wall, which was destroyed in the bombardment. The castle was returned to the Crown following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660.


=== From 1660 ===

The castle was used as a prison from the 1650s, and the garrison increased in 1658, and in 1662 it returned to the Crown. George Fox (1624–1691), founder of the Religious Society of Friends was imprisoned there from April 1665 to September 1666 for religious activities viewed as troublesome for Charles II (reigned 1660–1685). The castle declined again: James II (reigned 1685–1688) did not garrison it, he gambled that its defences would be sufficient to resist any Dutch invasion, but the town was seized for William of Orange during the Glorious Revolution that ousted James.The Jacobite Rebellion of 1745, a series of uprising aimed at restoring the Catholic House of Stuart to the throne, saw the castle refortified with gun batteries and barracks for 120 officers and men by 1746. The keep was used as a powder magazine, storing gunpowder, and the South Steel Battery was rebuilt. A barracks, containing twelve apartments accommodated 120 soldiers. Three batteries were built to  protect the town and harbour. Two faced south and the other was on the north side of the castle yard. In 1748, the Master Gunner's house was constructed and served as accommodation until the early 20th century and today hosts the exhibition on the castle. The castle saw no action during this time. Later still, the threat of French invasion during the Napoleonic Wars led to the permanent establishment of a garrison, which remained until the mid-19th century; French prisoners were held at the castle during 1796.During the First World War, Scarborough was used for British propaganda purposes after the bombardment of the town by two warships of the German Empire, SMS Derfflinger and SMS Von der Tann, on 16 December 1914. The raid killed 19 people and damaged the castle's keep, barracks and curtain walls. The castle was severely damaged by the hail of 500 shells directed at it and the town. The barracks were demolished due to the extensive damage wrought by the bombardment. In the Second World War, the castle served as a secret listening post.


== Features ==

The castle's location takes advantage of a naturally defensive site on a headland with steep cliffs, 300 feet (91 m) high, on three seaward sides. The promontory is joined to the mainland by an isthmus, where a ditch or moat was cut, and a wall or palisade with a gatehouse built on the southwest landward side. The stone curtain wall dates from the late 12th and early 13th centuries when it was strengthened by the addition of twelve round towers at intervals on its 230 yards (210 m) length. The wall does not surround the inner buildings of the castle. The entrance consists of a barbican, or fortifications to protect the gateway, completed in the 14th century and flanked by two half-circular towers on high ground. Modifications to the barbican have removed evidence of a portcullis and its grooves.  The barbican stands in the place of a 12th-century fortification built close to the remains of an 11th-century Anglo-Saxon chapel.
Beyond the main gateway, a stone bridge, built between 1337 and 1338, to replace two drawbridges, leads to the baileys or courtyards. It leads to the inner bailey, which was used for workshops, offices, a kitchen, and a storage area. Usually a castle's inner bailey is accessed through the outer bailey. However, the opposite is the case at Scarborough.
The 86-foot-tall (26 m) 12th-century keep and the castle's 150-foot-deep (46 m) well lie within the inner bailey. The keep, with its entrance on the first floor, survives as a shell, with the west wall, interior floors and roof missing, as a result of bombardment in the 17th century. With its sloping plinth to aid defence, flat roof and four turrets, this square four-storey building was over 100-foot-tall (30 m). The walls range from 11 to 15 feet (3.4 to 4.6 m) in thickness, the west wall being strongest, and there are several windows, some blocked up along its length. The corners have decorative rounded mouldings. There are the remains of a hearth in the west wall on the first floor, which comprised a single Great Hall, where the occupants ate and often slept. The second and third floors were each divided into two rooms for important visitors or the governor, and the basement was a storage area. Late 20th-century resistivity surveys of the inner bailey have traced the outlines of more 12th-century buildings.

The baileys are separated by a stone wall, ditch and bank, with two defended gateways.
The larger outer bailey would have seen entertaining events staged, vegetables grown, and animals kept; there was a graveyard and St. Mary's Chapel, which has completely disappeared, though the remains of the old Anglo-Saxon chapel on the site of an old Roman signal station can still be seen. A 12th-century medieval building, 100 feet (30 m) in length, stood in the outer bailey to accommodate royal visitors. It consisted of a long hall and private chamber with a fireplace used by the monarch, and rooms for preparing and storing food. The building was demolished sometime before a survey of 1538, which makes no mention of it: only the foundations, excavated in 1888, remain.In the outer bailey, a building named the ""King's Chambers"" or Mosdale Hall, after a 14th-century governor responsible for upgrading it, is an example of how the castle has been altered over the years. Originally built in the 13th century and upgraded by Mosdale after 1397, the two-storey building adjoining the curtain wall was converted to red-brick barracks in the 18th century. After being badly damaged by German shelling in 1914, the building was demolished. The red brickwork is clearly visible next to the much earlier outer stone wall, as viewed from Scarborough's South Bay. The 13th-century Queen's Tower, in the wall nearby, also had different uses: initially luxurious accommodation with private latrines, a porch and large windows with bay views were added in 1320. Two of these windows were later blocked up and one was changed to a cupboard with a rubbish chute. The Master Gunner's House, built in 1748, served as accommodation until the last on site caretaker, Hudson Rewcroft, retired in 1965. His nephew, Ted Temple shares his story of being the last resident of The Master Gunner's House in the Scarborough Review, June 2017 page12.


=== Development as a tourist attraction ===
During the second half of the 19th century the castle became a tourist attraction. The foundations of a medieval hall were excavated in 1888, and an 1890 photograph shows visitors using the grounds to practice archery. By 1920, the site was taken into public ownership by the Ministry of Works. The demolition of the 18th-century barracks exposed the medieval foundations of Mosdale Hall, which can still be seen.

The castle site, a scheduled ancient monument managed by English Heritage since 1984, is host to various events, usually in summertime, such as pirate and Robin Hood-themed activities and an annual Kite Festival. The castle grounds are reputed to be haunted – by three ghosts, among them a Roman soldier. The 18th-century Master Gunner's House, now a museum, has an exhibition whose centrepiece is a Bronze Age sword discovered in 1980. English Heritage invested £250,000 in making the site a tourist attraction.  A visitor centre provides admission to all extant remains, and has an exhibition of artefacts from the site and viewing platforms.

== Plot ==
After his victory the year prior, Jake proposes to continue the bet with Holt. This time, the task is that Jake needs to steal Holt's watch from his wrist before midnight. If Jake wins, Holt will do Jake's paperwork for one week, but if Jake loses, Jake will do five weeks of overtime without pay.
Getting help from the precinct, Jake brings in a pickpocket to help him steal the watch.  It proves successful and the criminal gets on to steal the watch. However, problems arise when the criminal runs away with the watch and Jake learns from Holt that the watch belonged to his husband Kevin's father before he died. He and Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio) meet with the criminal and gives him his money and shoes in exchange for knowing the location of the watch but are told the watch was already in his car. When they go to retrieve it, they find that the car has been towed. Meanwhile, Amy (Melissa Fumero) and Rosa (Stephanie Beatriz) are upset when Terry (Terry Crews) doesn't punish Gina (Chelsea Peretti) for skipping out on her duties at the precinct to attend dance practice. It is revealed that Gina has been secretly going back to college which has caused her to miss dance rehearsals.
While passing through a crowd of party-goers, Jake manages to get on a party bus to get to the impound lot but loses track of Boyle. When he arrives to impound, he finds he lost his badge and his ID and can't claim his car. He tries to sneak through the fence but is arrested by guards. In the interrogation room, he is told by Holt that he orchestrated everything for a year, that he annoyed Jake into wanting to steal his watch, and that the watch never left his person to begin with. The criminal was already on Holt's payroll, and Holt had organized everyone to go against Jake as everyone wants him humiliated. However, Boyle was taken before he boarded the party bus because he might have told Jake the plan.
In the end, Captain Holt and the group celebrates Holt's victory at the bar and Jake is forced to admit that Captain Holt ""is an amazing police captain/genius"" in addition to the five weeks of unpaid overtime. Jake tells Holt that he has already started planning for the next year's heist, to which Holt replies that he is only three months late in planning.


== Reception ==


=== Viewers ===
In its original American broadcast, ""Halloween II"" was seen by an estimated 5.22 million household viewers and gained a 2.5/7 ratings share among adults aged 18–49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This was a 15% increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 4.51 million viewers with a 2.2/6 in the 18-49 demographics. This means that 2.5 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 7 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. With these ratings, Brooklyn Nine-Nine was the second most watched show on FOX for the night, beating Mulaney and Family Guy but behind The Simpsons, fifth on its timeslot and fifth for the night, behind Once Upon a Time, The Simpsons, The OT, and NBC Sunday Night Football.


=== Critical reviews ===
""Halloween II"" received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics. LaToya Ferguson of The A.V. Club gave the episode an ""C+"" grade and wrote, ""The problem with Brooklyn Nine-Nine is that the 'bad' episodes are still at least decently humorous episodes of television. That's sort of a nonsense problem, but it still exists. Lesser episodes of the show may feature a lack of cohesion, but the audience can always rest assured that there will be an endless supply of quotable jokes. Now there's nothing wrong with being a joke factory, but that's not exactly what Brooklyn Nine-Nine is selling, and this episode is the perfect example that Brooklyn Nine-Nine can't simply rest on those joke laurels.""Jackson McHenry of Entertainment Weekly wrote, ""Sequels are like caricatures. In trying to replicate the original, they tend to exaggerate its basic elements to the point of ridiculousness. Minor things become overused: A funny side character turns into a main character, a cute gag inflates into the whole plot. This can be great — I'll defend Shrek 2 over the original any day — but the result usually ends up feeling a little thin. This week's Brooklyn Nine-Nine attempted to cap off last year's excellent 'Halloween' with a cheeky follow-up, but, with the same plots, and nearly the same conclusion, 'Halloween II' emphasized the show's weaknesses."" Allie Pape from Vulture gave the show a 4 star rating out of 5 and wrote, ""I've already come out strongly in favor of Brooklyn Nine-Nine's all-cast-antics episodes, particularly when it comes to reprising one of my favorites, last year's Halloween team-up to steal Holt's Medal of Valor. This year, the quarry was his watch, a gift from Kevin Cozner's dying father (but please don't call it the 'death watch'). And even though I could see two of the twists coming from a mile away — Holt winning this year because Peralta beating him twice would throw off the balance of power between the two, and Fingers the thief stealing the watch once he got a chance because duh — I still enjoyed watching it all go down.""Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote, ""Another solid outing in a season that's been clicking very well so far. And I like the idea of Halloween bets being a tradition on this show like Ron & Tammy or Bar Wars episodes on some other fine comedies."" Andy Crump of Paste gave the episode a 6.7 and wrote, ""The good news here is that Brooklyn Nine-Nine doesn't seem to be losing its spirit. It will forever remain a tribute to farce, with an endless supply of zany vim. It does, however, appear to be losing its direction, which may be a bit of an alarmist observation, given that we're only four episodes deep into Season Two. But 'Halloween II' gets too wrapped up in its central caper to deliver on its best attribute — its character work. Without that, Brooklyn Nine-Nine is just another sitcom to breeze through, rather than savor.""

It would follow a very similar combat path to the 108th and 109th Guards Rifle Divisions and would serve well into the postwar era.
The 110th joined the active Army on September 7 as part of 37th Army of Steppe Front during the advance through eastern Ukraine to the Dniepr River. Upon reaching this objective late in the month it helped to force a crossing southeast of Kremenchug following which nearly 30 of the division's personnel were made Heroes of the Soviet Union. By October 10 the bridgehead was well established and on the 15th the division began breaking out as part of 5th Guards Army. In very short order in December and January 1944 the 110th Guards was awarded a divisional honorific, the Order of the Red Banner and the Order of Suvorov. During February it was transferred to the 49th Rifle Corps of 53rd Army; it would remain under this Army command for the duration of the war and this Corps for most of it. Along with the rest of 2nd Ukrainian Front it reached the border of Moldavia along the Dniestr River in early April but the advance soon stalled along this line. When a new offensive against the Axis forces began in August the 53rd Army played a secondary role and quickly advanced through Romania and into Hungary, reaching the border with Slovakia by December. Once Budapest fell in February 1945 the 110th Guards joined in the offensive which overran the latter country in March and April, during which its regiments received several decorations. After finishing the war with Germany near Prague it then moved with its Army to the far east, joining the 18th Guards Rifle Corps, and took part in the offensive into Manchuria, winning a second battle honor in the process although it saw little actual fighting. After the war it was moved with its Corps to western Siberia but was soon converted back to a Guards rifle brigade at Irkutsk.","The 110th Guards Rifle Division was formed as an elite infantry division of the Red Army from  July into September 1943, based on the 5th Guards Rifle Brigade and the 7th Guards Rifle Brigade and was the third of a small series of Guards divisions formed on a similar basis. It would follow a very similar combat path to the 108th and 109th Guards Rifle Divisions and would serve well into the postwar era.
The 110th joined the active Army on September 7 as part of 37th Army of Steppe Front during the advance through eastern Ukraine to the Dniepr River. Upon reaching this objective late in the month it helped to force a crossing southeast of Kremenchug following which nearly 30 of the division's personnel were made Heroes of the Soviet Union. By October 10 the bridgehead was well established and on the 15th the division began breaking out as part of 5th Guards Army. In very short order in December and January 1944 the 110th Guards was awarded a divisional honorific, the Order of the Red Banner and the Order of Suvorov. During February it was transferred to the 49th Rifle Corps of 53rd Army; it would remain under this Army command for the duration of the war and this Corps for most of it. Along with the rest of 2nd Ukrainian Front it reached the border of Moldavia along the Dniestr River in early April but the advance soon stalled along this line. When a new offensive against the Axis forces began in August the 53rd Army played a secondary role and quickly advanced through Romania and into Hungary, reaching the border with Slovakia by December. Once Budapest fell in February 1945 the 110th Guards joined in the offensive which overran the latter country in March and April, during which its regiments received several decorations. After finishing the war with Germany near Prague it then moved with its Army to the far east, joining the 18th Guards Rifle Corps, and took part in the offensive into Manchuria, winning a second battle honor in the process although it saw little actual fighting. After the war it was moved with its Corps to western Siberia but was soon converted back to a Guards rifle brigade at Irkutsk.


== Formation ==
By mid-1943 most of the Red Army's remaining rifle brigades were being amalgamated into rifle divisions as experience had shown this was a more efficient use of manpower.


=== 5th Guards Rifle Brigade ===
This brigade began service as the 2nd formation of the 1st Airborne Brigade which had formed in Volkhov Front in February - March 1942. It was soon assigned to the 6th Guards Rifle Corps but largely remained in the Front reserves until July 30 when it began reforming as the 5th Guards Rifle Brigade far to the south in the Transcaucasus Military District. In August it was moved to the North Caucasus where it joined the 10th Guards Rifle Corps and it remained under this command until it was reformed. For nearly a year it took part in battles against German Army Group A in the Caucasus region, eventually facing the defenses of 17th Army in the Kuban bridgehead in the early summer of 1943. In July it was removed to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command and sent to the Voronezh region.


=== 7th Guards Rifle Brigade ===
The 7th Guards was formed from July 30 to August 10, 1942 from the 3rd formation of the 3rd Airborne Brigade in the Transcaucasus Military District and was immediately assigned to the 10th Guards Rifle Corps. By January 1943 it had reached the German defenses in the Taman Peninsula and for the next several months was involved in the costly and mostly futile battles of attrition for these powerful positions, during which it was awarded the Order of the Red Banner on March 31. In July it was also moved to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command for rebuilding and reforming.On August 3, 1943 the combined brigades officially became the 110th Guards in the 37th Army which was in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command; as they were already Guards formations there was no presentation of a Guards banner. Once the division completed its reorganization its non-standard order of battle was as follows:

307th Guards Rifle Regiment
310th Guards Rifle Regiment
313th Guards Rifle Regiment
247th Guards Cannon Artillery Regiment
636th Guards Divisional Artillery Brigade
823rd Guards Mortar Regiment
109th Guards Antitank Battalion
106th Guards Reconnaissance Company
117th Guards Sapper Battalion
169th Guards Signal Battalion (later 141st Guards Signal Company)
111th Guards Medical/Sanitation Battalion
107th Guards Chemical Defense (Anti-gas) Company
108th Guards Motor Transport Company
112th Guards Field Bakery
104th Guards Divisional Veterinary Hospital
2290th Field Postal Station
1274th Field Office of the State BankThe division was placed under the command of Col. Mikhail Ivanovich Ogorodov who had previously served as deputy commanding officer of the 3rd Rifle Corps and had been appointed commander of the 7th Guards Brigade while it was in Reserve. It had considerably more artillery than a standard regular or Guards rifle division, close to that of a small rifle corps. (Its veterinary hospital also shared the same number with that of the 109th Guards.) When it joined the active army in September it was noted that 70 percent of its personnel were of several Asian nationalities while nearly all the remainder were Russian. The division did not inherit the Order of the Red Banner from the 7th Brigade.


== Battle of the Dniepr ==
As of the beginning of September the 37th Army consisted of four rifle divisions (62nd Guards, 92nd Guards, 110th Guards and 53rd Rifle Division) all under command of 57th Rifle Corps. As the Red Army advanced through eastern Ukraine that month the Army was released from the Reserve of the Supreme High Command to reinforce Steppe Front (as of October 20 2nd Ukrainian Front). The Army began its offensive operation on September 24 along the approaches to the Dniepr in conjunction with the neighboring 53rd and 7th Guards Armies.Steppe Front was facing the German 8th Army and part of the 1st Panzer Army which at this time were withdrawing toward Kremenchug in order to cross the Dniepr and organize a defense on its right (west) bank. 37th Army was in the Front's second echelon and was tasked with seizing a bridgehead southeast of that city following initial crossings by 69th Army. This Army had been weakened in previous fighting and was disregarded as a threat by the German command. 37th Army's commander, Lt. Gen. M. N. Sharokhin, was ordered to force march to the 69th's sector and capture a bridgehead between Uspenskoye and Myshuryn Rih on September 27. For this purpose the Army was heavily reinforced from the 69th Army, including the 89th Guards Rifle Division and a great deal of artillery. As of September 25 the 110th Guards recorded a strength of 8,818 men; 490 light and 171 heavy machine guns; 75 82mm and 16 120mm mortars; 40 45mm antitank guns; 32 76mm cannons and 12 122mm howitzers. (The division's additional artillery assets are not included.) This was very similar to that of the other divisions in 57th Corps.The division comprised the Corps' second echelon and was ordered to concentrate in the Baranniki–Zabegailovka–Kovalenki area by 1600 hours on September 27, making ready to force the river. The forward detachments of the first echelon 62nd Guards and 92nd Guards had reached the Dniepr as early as 0200 hours that day while the 110th Guards was on the march northeast of Ozery, 15-20km from the river. The leading divisions were unable to immediately start crossing operations due to the absence of equipment and had to gather materials for rafts and other improvised means. General Sharokhin and a group of staff officers soon arrived at Ozery and organized an auxiliary command post. 37th Army's crossing sector was 29km wide and the Army had a total of 1,204 guns and mortars available, although a significant number of these had fallen behind due to shortages of fuel. 57th Corps had about 655 guns and mortars available to support the crossings of the forward detachments. The remnants of the German 106th and 39th Infantry Divisions, numbering about 4,500 officers and men with up to 200 machine guns and up to 160 guns and mortars, were withdrawing across the river near the village of Koleberda en route to taking up a 25km-wide defensive sector along the west bank. In addition elements of the 8th SS Cavalry Division Florian Geyer were operating on that bank.
The 62nd Guards was able to land two battalions beginning at the onset of darkness on the 27th, one on an island southwest of Soloshino and the other at a jetty north of Myshuryn Rih. At the same time the 92nd Guards attempted a crossing to another island south of Botsuly but this was discovered while still in mid-river; two pontoons were sunk by artillery fire and a third forced back which caused the crossing to be suspended. By the end of the day on September 28 the 62nd's 182nd Guards Rifle Regiment held a bridgehead 4-6km deep and 5-6km wide while the 184th Guards Regiment had also obtained a smaller but still substantial lodgement. The main goal of 37th Army on September 29-30 was to expand the existing bridgeheads, consolidate them, and repel increasingly powerful counterattacks. Overnight on September 28/29 the 110th Guards was committed from 57th Corps' second echelon to reinforce the 62nd Guards' bridgeheads. As well various crossing equipment arrived with the Army, including 21 half-pontoons and 67 boats, both A-3 small inflatables and collapsible canvas-sided types. During the day elements of the 23rd Panzer Division began arriving in the Myshuryn Rih area. Overnight on September 29/30 the 92nd Guards' 282nd Guards Rifle Regiment was landed in the 62nd Guards bridgehead east of Deriivka, while the remainder of that division's own forces, apart from its artillery regiment, crossed as well.The 110th Guards was directed to launch its main attack, after crossing, on Kutsevolovka and Ustimovka and occupy a line from Hill 158.4 to Yasinovatka and subsequently to take Ustimovka. Sharokhin was determined to have four divisions across the Dniepr by the end of September 29 holding a bridgehead 30km wide and 10km deep, but this was unrealistic. Since most of the available crossing equipment was in use by the 62nd Guards the division was delayed until 1700 hours, well behind schedule. By midnight two battalions of the 310th Guards Rifle Regiment and all three of the 313th Guards Regiment's battalions had entered the 62nd Guards' bridgehead, with the latter Regiment concentrating in the Koshikov ravine along the northern outskirts of Myshuryn Rih on the 62nd Guards' right flank. The 307th Guards Rifle Regiment and the divisional artillery remained on the east bank. Heavy fighting for the bridgehead began at dawn. 23rd Panzer had been ordered to eliminate the foothold, and began with two attacks from 0500 to 0600 hours with up to a battalion of infantry backed by 20 tanks from the Nezamozhnik area. These attacks were beaten off by artillery and machine gun fire but a renewed effort from Kaluzhino at 1100 hours managed to break through with 15 tanks and 11 Sd.Kfz. 251 vehicles carrying infantry to the area of height 127.5. A decisive counterattack drove these off but the 62nd Guards had to largely rely on its own resources; the 110th Guards was forced to be committed piecemeal and along several axes and without necessary artillery support. The 310th and 307th Guards Regiments reached Lake Liman and got into a battle for Deriivka while Sharokhin ordered the 313th Guards Regiment to move up to the northeastern outskirts of Myshuryn Rih to secure the Army's flank.For October 1 the 92nd Guards and 110th Guards received orders to seize Deriivka and reach a line from the Pershe Travnya Collective Farm to Petrovka to Ploskoye. Meanwhile the 43rd Tank Regiment was directed to cross to the right bank overnight and to operate with the division to expand the bridgehead; it was able to convey nine T-34s before dawn. By this time the German defense included from 100-130 tanks with the arrival of lead elements of 3rd SS Panzergrenadier Division Totenkopf and Großdeutschland Division. During the morning the division finally completed its crossing and the 307th and 310th Guards Regiments were fighting for the southern part of Deriivka and Kutsevolovka; by day's end the division had captured the southeastern part of Deriivka, Hill 167.8 and Kutsevolovka. In addition the 313th Guards Regiment, in cooperation with the 30th Guards Airborne Regiment of the 10th Guards Airborne Rifle Division (82nd Rifle Corps), cleared Myshuryn Rih and reached its southern outskirts. Despite these gains the overall bridgehead remained much the same size due to ongoing counterattacks and the persistent shortage of crossing equipment and ammunition.


=== Battle for Height 177.0 ===
By 1400 hours on October 2 the 43rd Tanks completed its crossing and assisted the 110th Guards in repelling two powerful counterattacks before advancing together up to 1000m and taking the line of heights from point 179.9 to point 192.7. General Sharokhin's first priority for the following day was to link up the lodgements of his 57th Corps and the 89th Guards. However, the German forces in the area south of Myshuryn Rih were now being reinforced with elements of the 6th Panzer Division. During the day the 307th Guards Regiment was involved in fighting for Hill 158.4 and Guardsman Pavel Sergeevich Ponomaryov began his path toward becoming one of nearly 30 men of the division to be made Heroes of the Soviet Union. Serving as a gun layer on one of the Regiment's 45mm antitank guns he moved his gun to an open space when the advance was being held up a German heavy machine gun; with one shot he destroyed the position. Later that day, during a counterattack his fire destroyed a tank and an automobile. On October 7 the Regiment was counterattacked at height 177.0 by infantry supported by 10 tanks. After assisting other gunners in forcing the infantry to ground with the fire of fragmentation shells Ponomaryov set the lead tank on fire and knocked out two more at a range of 150m-200m, forcing the rest to retreat. On February 22, 1944 he was awarded the Gold Star and the Order of Lenin while he was in hospital, having been seriously wounded in both legs on October 26. He never returned to the front but continued to serve in the training establishment until 1976 when he retired with the rank of captain. He died at Tashkent in 1990.37th Army had received more crossing equipment and overnight on October 3/4 began moving the 1st Mechanized Corps to the west bank; by morning all of 57th Corps, including artillery, was over as well. The Corps renewed the offensive along with 82nd Corps but they were unable to achieve any decisive success due to fierce resistance and numerous counterattacks. Units of the 110th Guards were involved in particularly heavy fighting. Despite this by day's end four ferry crossings to the bridgehead were operating regularly and its depth, now up to 8km, prevented aimed German artillery fire against them. On the following night the division made an attack and occupied a line from height 118.1 to height 105.2 to height 177.0. Its officers and men acted boldly and decisively in this night action. Having broken into the trench line the Guardsmen killed 20 German soldiers in hand-to-hand combat and captured a gun. The commander of a platoon, Lieutenant Maslya, turned the weapon on the German troops and forced them to fall back. Although wounded, Maslya continued to lead his unit.For October 6 Sharokhin placed the priority on linking up with the 7th Guards Army's bridgehead and ordered the 57th Corps to hold its positions and pin down the German forces to prevent them from interfering with the main effort. During the next four days stubborn fighting continued along the 37th Army's front. On October 9 the action was particularly intense on the 110th Guards' sector, where the German forces undertook eight counterattacks in strength of one to two battalions of infantry supported by 8-12 tanks. In bitter fighting and at heavy cost these attacks managed to push back elements of the division on individual sectors. The 307th Guards Rifle Regiment was pushed back on the night of October 8/9 to the area of height 177.0. This point was only seized when all its defenders were killed or wounded, but the struggle continued into the morning when a company of scouts and sappers from the Regiment's headquarters retook the height. During the afternoon a further costly attack put the position in German hands again.On this day another man of the division earned the Gold Star of a Hero of the Soviet Union. Guardsman Gainansha Haydarshinovich Haydarshin was a section leader of the 117th Guards Sapper Battalion and during the day made no fewer than 27 boat crossings of the Dniepr carrying men, equipment and ammunition. On the last trip his boat was pierced by a mortar shell fragment and began to sink but he was able to repair it well enough to make the far bank. After landing he joined the fighting on Hill 177.0 and knocked out a tank despite being injured by blast. His award was decreed on February 22, 1944 and his Gold Star was presented personally by Marshal G. K. Zhukov. Haydarshin was discharged from the Red Army the same month and returned to his native Bashkiria where he worked in agriculture until his retirement. He died on December 4, 2006 at the age of 95. During the next day it became clear that the German forces were exhausted and the Front commander, Col. Gen. I. S. Konev, ordered the 5th Guards Army to enter the Myshuryn Rih bridgehead and expand it in preparation for a planned breakout by 5th Guards Tank Army in the direction of Piatykhatky.


== Into Western Ukraine ==
The 110th Guards was transferred to 5th Guards Army later in the month after that Army crossed to the west bank and served into early November directly under Army control. The Kremenchug-Pyatikhatki Offensive began on October 15 when a dozen rifle divisions attacked out of the bridgehead and by the next day had torn open the left flank of 1st Panzer Army. On October 18 Piatykhatky was liberated, cutting the main railroads to Dnepropetrovsk and Kryvyi Rih, which was the obvious next objective. The lead elements of 2nd Ukrainian Front reached the outskirts of Kryvyi Rih but were counterattacked on the 27th by the XXXX Panzer Corps, driving them back some 32km and doing considerable damage to the Red Army formations in the process.


=== Battles in the Dniepr Bend ===
On November 13 the 2nd Ukrainian Front gained several small bridgeheads on both sides of Cherkasy and quickly expanded the one north until it threatened to engulf the city and tear open the front of German 8th Army. Ten days later, with gaps in its front lines around the Cherkasy bridgehead and north of Kryvyi Rih, the chief of staff of that Army pleaded for permission to stage a general withdrawal but this was denied. During November and the first three weeks of December Konev was content to fight a battle of attrition with the 1st Panzer and 8th Armies which he could better afford, gradually clearing the right bank of the Dniepr north to Cherkasy. As of December 1 the 110th Guards was in the 32nd Guards Rifle Corps of 5th Guards Army.On December 6 the division was recognized for its role in the expansion of the Dniepr bridgehead and the liberation of the city of Aleksandria with its name as a battle honor. Just days later, on December 10 the 110th Guards was awarded the Order of the Red Banner in recognition of its role in this fighting, The Front was ordered over to the defensive on December 20 as replacements were absorbed by the fighting units and supplies were replenished. On January 5, 1944 it threw a powerful blow directly at the boundary between the 8th and 6th German Armies which broke through and swept northward, reaching nearly to Kirovograd in a matter of hours. The next day the attack swept north and south around the city, encircling the XXXXVII Panzer Corps, which was forced to break out and abandon the city on January 8. On the same date the division was decorated with the Order of Suvorov, 2nd Degree. Colonel Ogorodov was hospitalized due to illness on January 10 and was replaced by his deputy commander Col. Dmitrii Filippovich Sobolev.
Appalling freeze-and-thaw weather brought the offensive to a premature end on the 16th. On January 24 a Front reconnaissance-in-force hit a nearly 20km-wide stretch of 8th Army's line between Cherkasy and Kirovograd where there was no more than one infantryman for every 15 metres of front and penetrated deeply. This marked the start of the start of the encirclement battle of Korsun–Cherkassy which continued until February 16 but did not involve 5th Guards Army or the 110th Guards directly.


=== Advance to the Dniestr and First Jassy–Kishinev Offensive ===
In February the division was transferred to the 49th Rifle Corps in 53rd Army, and it would remain in this Army for the duration of the war. The Soviet spring offensive in the south began on March 4. 53rd Army was west of a line from Kirovograd to Cherkasy roughly in the center of its Front. Marshal Konev's first target was the city of Uman, which was taken on March 9, but two days earlier a secondary thrust by his left flank armies again struck the 6th Army/8th Army boundary. Within days the German forces were in full retreat toward the Southern Bug River, but the advance did not end there.By April 1, after advancing through western Ukraine, 2nd Ukrainian Front was beginning to reach the Dniestr River. The 21st Guards Rifle Corps, supported on the left by 49th Corps, crossed the river on April 1 and 2 and began advancing against the 3rd Panzer Division's bridgehead defenses north of Susleni from the northeast and east. While this advance continued the 49th Corps attacked 3rd Panzer's right wing through April 4 and 5, with the 110th Guards and 1st Guards Airborne Rifle Divisions in first echelon and the 375th Rifle Division was in second echelon. Susleni was taken on April 7, which drove the panzer troops south to even stronger defenses. On the 11th the continued joint operation of the two Soviet Corps captured the town of Molovata on the west bank; this gave room for the 375th to be regrouped across the Dniestr and also rendered the bridgehead held by XXXX Panzer Corps north of the Răut River untenable. It was abandoned overnight on April 12/13, while the 49th Corps took over a sector from Furceni on the Răut to Holercani on the Dniestr.The next objective for 53rd Army, commanded by Lt. Gen. I. M. Managarov, was the German bridgehead east of the Dniestr on the approaches to the cities of Dubăsari and Grigoriopol. 49th Corps had begun this advance on March 31, but had then been diverted to the fighting on the west bank. On April 13, with all three of the Corps' divisions west of the river, supported by 25th Guards Rifle Division, the advance resumed with heavy attacks on the German 282nd Infantry Division on the Golerkani sector. After two days of heavy fighting the German force withdrew southward to new defenses west of Dubăsari, but also received reinforcements from the 10th Panzergrenadier Division and Corps Detachment ""F"" which contained the Soviet advance. By this time the divisions of 53rd Army had fewer than 5,000 personnel each, and on April 18 the Front command ordered the Army over to the defense.The same day Col. Ivan Adamovich Rotkevich took over command of the division from Colonel Sobolev who had taken over the 1st Guards Airborne Division; that officer would go on to become a Hero of the Soviet Union in April 1945. Colonel Rotkevich in turn was replaced by Col. Ivan Alekseevich Pigin on April 28 before Ogorodov returned on May 9, now with the rank of major general. On May 6 the 53rd Army received orders to take part in a new offensive on Chișinău that was to be primarily conducted by forces of 3rd Ukrainian Front. 49th Corps was to commit the 110th Guards to reinforce 26th Guards Rifle Corps as part of the Army's shock group, while the 375th and 1st Guards Airborne were to remain on the defense on the Army's front westward to south of Orhei. In the event, the defeat inflicted on the right flank forces of 2nd Ukrainian Front in the Târgu Frumos area caused this offensive to be postponed and eventually cancelled.


=== Second Jassy–Kishinev Offensive ===
By the beginning of June the 110th Guards was serving as a separate rifle division under direct Army control but a month later it returned to 49th Corps; as of August 1 the Corps contained only the 110th Guards and the 375th while the 1st Guards Airborne was serving separately. In the buildup to the Second Jassy–Kishinev Offensive in early August the 53rd Army was regrouped out of the front line into Front reserves. 49th Corps was ordered to move from the Front's left flank to the center which required four daily marches. The plan called for the Army to be part of the exploitation force which would be released once the shock formations penetrated the German–Romanian front. Once this occurred the Army was to advance in the general direction of Vaslui and Focșani. The offensive opened on August 20, and on the next day at 1900 hours the 53rd began moving up to the positions that had been vacated by the advancing 52nd Army. The Army was then ordered to move to the area south of the road from Podu Iloaiei to Iași overnight on August 22/23. In the following days minimal forces of the 53rd Army were committed to the reduction of the trapped Axis grouping while its main effort focused on Bucharest and the oilfields at Ploiești.


== Hungarian Campaign ==
Following its advance through Romania, on October 28 the left flank forces of 2nd Ukrainian Front, including 53rd Army, began an operation to defeat the German-Hungarian forces in and around Budapest. The main drive was carried out by 7th Guards and 46th Armies while the 53rd provided flank security. On October 29 the Army advanced up to 13km and reached the outskirts of Polgár. By the morning of November 4 the 27th Army relieved the 53rd along the front from Polgár to Tiszafüred while it regrouped to force the Tisza River three days later. On November 11 the Army's right flank corps began fighting for the southern outskirts of Füzesabony; the town did not finally fall until the 15th after which General Managarov was ordered to develop the offensive in the direction of Verpelét. By November 20 the 53rd reached the southeastern slopes of the Mátra Mountains between Gyöngyös and Eger where the Axis forces were able to organize a powerful defense which brought the advance to a halt until November 26.After it resumed Jr. Lt. Anatolii Petrovich Vishnevskii earned a posthumous Gold Star as a Hero of the Soviet Union on November 28. In fighting for the village of Andornaktálya on the outskirts of Eger the commander of Vishnevskii's battalion of the 307th Guards Rifle Regiment was killed and his deputy severely wounded. As the battalion Komsomol leader he took effective lead, renewed the attack and was the first man into the German trenches, killing three enemy soldiers in hand-to-hand combat. On the outskirts of the village the battalion was attacked by an armored halftrack which was destroyed with grenades by Vishnevskii and one other man. Later, within the village itself, the battalion was held up by a German machine gun in a cellar; Vishnevskii crawled up to the position and threw a grenade but was mortally wounded in the chest in the process. Despite his wounds his next grenade destroyed the gun and its crew. He was buried in Eger and was decreed a Hero of the Soviet Union on April 28, 1945. A school in his home city of Kharkiv was named in his honor. On December 16 the 307th Guards Regiment was awarded the Order of the Red Banner and the 247th Guards Cannon Artillery Regiment received the Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky, 2nd Degree, for their roles in the fighting for Eger and Szikszó.


=== Advance into Slovakia ===
By this time the division had been assigned back to the 57th Rifle Corps along with the 1st Guards Airborne and the 228th Rifle Division. A new phase of the offensive began on December 5. 53rd Army occupied a line from Eger to Lőrinci facing units of the German 6th Army and the Hungarian 3rd Army. The assault began at 1015 hours following a brief but powerful artillery preparation and the Army was able to advance 2-4km on the first day despite facing defenses in mountainous terrain and the fighting continued through the night. In the days following the Army was only able to advance with its left-flank units and by December 9 was stalled along a line from Eger to Gyöngyös. The next phase involved completing the encirclement of Budapest and began on December 10 but again the 53rd Army advanced very little until Pliyev's Cavalry-Mechanized Group rolled up the German/Hungarian defense from the Šahy area in the general direction of Szoldiny.On December 14 Plyiev was ordered to attack in the direction of Kisterenye in conjunction with 53rd Army advancing toward Pásztó. This made only modest progress and on December 18 General Managarov was directed to relieve Plyiev's Group to enable it to regroup for a new assignment. The next day the Army was tasked with reaching a line from Veľký Krtíš to Nemce to Želiezovce. The left-flank forces of 2nd Ukrainian Front attacked at 1000 hours on December 20 but on the first day the 53rd Army made only local advances. By December 29 it had reached a front from Kutas to Szécsény to Balassagyarmat. The encirclement of Budapest had been completed on December 26, and as of January 1, 1945 the 110th Guards had returned to 49th Rifle Corps where it joined with the 375th Rifle Division. Under this command the division played little direct role in the siege of Budapest.
Prior the defeat of the German Operation Spring Awakening in mid-March, mainly by 3rd Ukrainian Front, the 2nd Ukrainian Front renewed its advance into Czechoslovakia with 53rd Army roughly in the center of the Front. At this time it was noted that the personnel of the 110th Guards were roughly 67 percent Russian of the 1926-27 year groups, making a very young cadre, while most of the remainder were of Ukrainian nationality. Units of the Army liberated Banská Štiavnica on March 7 and in recognition for their roles the 310th Guards Rifle Regiment was awarded the Order of the Red Banner while the 313th Guards Regiment received the Order of Kutuzov, 3rd Degree, both on April 5. On April 19 General Ogorodov was directed to attend the K. Е. Voroshilov Higher Military Academy and he was replaced the next day by Col. Aleksandr Ivanovich Malchevskii who had just completed studies at the same institution. Following the German surrender, on May 17 the 307th Guards Regiment was presented with the Order of Suvorov, 3rd Degree, for its role in the liberation of Komárno, Vráble and other Slovakian towns.


== Manchurian Campaign and Postwar ==
53rd Army was selected for transfer to the far east for the campaign against the Japanese Kwantung Army in Manchuria, largely due to its experience in fighting through the Carpathian Mountains during 1944-45. On July 8 Hero of the Soviet Union Maj. Gen. Grigorii Arkhipovich Krivolapov took over command of the division from Colonel Malchevskii. After crossing the continent via the Trans-Siberian Railway it joined the Transbaikal Front; by the beginning of August the 110th Guards was in the 18th Guards Rifle Corps, which also contained the 109th Guards Rifle and 1st Guards Airborne Divisions.The Soviet operation began on August 9 but 53rd Army was in the Front's second echelon and remained in assembly areas in Mongolia until the second day when it began crossing the border in the tracks of 6th Guards Tank Army. The commander of Japanese 3rd Area Army had already ordered those of his forces not already cut off to withdraw to defend north and south of Mukden. The advance largely became a challenge to overcome the narrow roads and mountain passes of the Greater Khingan range. The Army accomplished this and on August 15 moved into the yawning gap between the 17th Army and 6th Guards Tanks with the objective to secure Kailu. The advance was unhindered and on September 1 the 53rd Army occupied Kailu, Chaoyang, Fuxin and Gushanbeitseifu while forward detachments reached the Chinchou area on the Gulf of Liaotung. In recognition of this victory the 110th Guards was awarded the honorific ""Khingan"" later that month.
With this final addition the soldiers of the division shared the official title 110th Guards Rifle, Aleksandria-Khingan, Order of the Red Banner, Order of Suvorov Division. (Russian: 110-я гвардейская стрелковая Александрийско-Хинганская Краснознамённая ордена Суворова дивизия.) 53rd Army was disbanded in October and in 1946 the 18th Guards Corps was transferred to the West Siberian Military District and headquartered at Omsk although the 110th was stationed at Irkutsk. In June 1946 it was converted to the 16th Guards Rifle Brigade and its successors continued to serve into the late 1950s.

== Development ==

SHA-1 produces a message digest based on principles similar to those used by Ronald L. Rivest of MIT in the design of the MD2, MD4 and MD5 message digest algorithms, but generates a larger hash value (160 bits vs. 128 bits).
SHA-1 was developed as part of the U.S. Government's Capstone project. The original specification of the algorithm was published in 1993 under the title Secure Hash Standard, FIPS PUB 180, by U.S. government standards agency NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). This version is now often named SHA-0. It was withdrawn by the NSA shortly after publication and was superseded by the revised version, published in 1995 in FIPS PUB 180-1 and commonly designated SHA-1. SHA-1 differs from SHA-0 only by a single bitwise rotation in the message schedule of its compression function. According to the NSA, this was done to correct a flaw in the original algorithm which reduced its cryptographic security, but they did not provide any further explanation. Publicly available techniques did indeed demonstrate a compromise of SHA-0, in 2004, before SHA-1 in 2017. See #Attacks


== Applications ==


=== Cryptography ===

SHA-1 forms part of several widely used security applications and protocols, including TLS and SSL, PGP, SSH, S/MIME, and IPsec. Those applications can also use MD5; both MD5 and SHA-1 are descended from MD4.
SHA-1 and SHA-2 are the hash algorithms required by law for use in certain U.S. government applications, including use within other cryptographic algorithms and protocols, for the protection of sensitive unclassified information. FIPS PUB 180-1 also encouraged adoption and use of SHA-1 by private and commercial organizations. SHA-1 is being retired from most government uses; the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology said, ""Federal agencies should stop using SHA-1 for...applications that require collision resistance as soon as practical, and must use the SHA-2 family of hash functions for these applications after 2010"" (emphasis in original), though that was later relaxed to allow SHA-1 to be used for verifying old digital signatures and time stamps.A prime motivation for the publication of the Secure Hash Algorithm was the Digital Signature Standard, in which it is incorporated.
The SHA hash functions have been used for the basis of the SHACAL block ciphers.


=== Data integrity ===
Revision control systems such as Git, Mercurial, and Monotone use SHA-1, not for security, but to identify revisions and to ensure that the data has not changed due to accidental corruption. Linus Torvalds said about Git:

If you have disk corruption, if you have DRAM corruption, if you have any kind of problems at all, Git will notice them. It's not a question of if, it's a guarantee. You can have people who try to be malicious. They won't succeed. ... Nobody has been able to break SHA-1, but the point is the SHA-1, as far as Git is concerned, isn't even a security feature. It's purely a consistency check. The security parts are elsewhere, so a lot of people assume that since Git uses SHA-1 and SHA-1 is used for cryptographically secure stuff, they think that, Okay, it's a huge security feature. It has nothing at all to do with security, it's just the best hash you can get. ...
I guarantee you, if you put your data in Git, you can trust the fact that five years later, after it was converted from your hard disk to DVD to whatever new technology and you copied it along, five years later you can verify that the data you get back out is the exact same data you put in. ...
One of the reasons I care is for the kernel, we had a break in on one of the BitKeeper sites where people tried to corrupt the kernel source code repositories.  However Git does not require the second preimage resistance of SHA-1 as a security feature, since it will always prefer to keep the earliest version of an object in case of collision, preventing an attacker from surreptitiously overwriting files.


== Cryptanalysis and validation ==
For a hash function for which L is the number of bits in the message digest, finding a message that corresponds to a given message digest can always be done using a brute force search in approximately 2L evaluations. This is called a preimage attack and may or may not be practical depending on L and the particular computing environment. However, a collision, consisting of finding two different messages that produce the same message digest, requires on average only about 1.2 × 2L/2 evaluations using a birthday attack. Thus the strength of a hash function is usually compared to a symmetric cipher of half the message digest length. SHA-1, which has a 160-bit message digest, was originally thought to have 80-bit strength.
Some of the applications that use cryptographic hashes, like password storage, are only minimally affected by a collision attack. Constructing a password that works for a given account requires a preimage attack, as well as access to the hash of the original password, which may or may not be trivial. Reversing password encryption (e.g. to obtain a password to try against a user's account elsewhere) is not made possible by the attacks. (However, even a secure password hash can't prevent brute-force attacks on weak passwords.)
In the case of document signing, an attacker could not simply fake a signature from an existing document: The attacker would have to produce a pair of documents, one innocuous and one damaging, and get the private key holder to sign the innocuous document. There are practical circumstances in which this is possible; until the end of 2008, it was possible to create forged SSL certificates using an MD5 collision.Due to the block and iterative structure of the algorithms and the absence of additional final steps, all SHA functions (except SHA-3) are vulnerable to length-extension and partial-message collision attacks. These attacks allow an attacker to forge a message signed only by a keyed hash – SHA(message || key) or SHA(key || message) – by extending the message and recalculating the hash without knowing the key. A simple improvement to prevent these attacks is to hash twice: SHAd(message) = SHA(SHA(0b || message)) (the length of 0b, zero block, is equal to the block size of the hash function).


=== SHA-0 ===
At CRYPTO 98, two French researchers, Florent Chabaud and Antoine Joux, presented an attack on SHA-0: collisions can be found with complexity 261, fewer than the 280 for an ideal hash function of the same size.In 2004, Biham and Chen found near-collisions for SHA-0 – two messages that hash to nearly the same value; in this case, 142 out of the 160 bits are equal. They also found full collisions of SHA-0 reduced to 62 out of its 80 rounds.Subsequently, on 12 August 2004, a collision for the full SHA-0 algorithm was announced by Joux, Carribault, Lemuet, and Jalby. This was done by using a generalization of the Chabaud and Joux attack. Finding the collision had complexity 251 and took about 80,000 processor-hours on a supercomputer with 256 Itanium 2 processors (equivalent to 13 days of full-time use of the computer).
On 17 August 2004, at the Rump Session of CRYPTO 2004, preliminary results were announced by Wang, Feng, Lai, and Yu, about an attack on MD5, SHA-0 and other hash functions. The complexity of their attack on SHA-0 is 240, significantly better than the attack by Joux et al.In February 2005, an attack by Xiaoyun Wang, Yiqun Lisa Yin, and Hongbo Yu was announced which could find collisions in SHA-0 in 239 operations.Another attack in 2008 applying the boomerang attack brought the complexity of finding collisions down to 233.6, which was estimated to take 1 hour on an average PC from the year 2008.In light of the results for SHA-0, some experts suggested that plans for the use of SHA-1 in new cryptosystems should be reconsidered. After the CRYPTO 2004 results were published, NIST announced that they planned to phase out the use of SHA-1 by 2010 in favor of the SHA-2 variants.


=== Attacks ===
In early 2005, Vincent Rijmen and Elisabeth Oswald published an attack on a reduced version of SHA-1 – 53 out of 80 rounds – which finds collisions with a computational effort of fewer than 280 operations.In February 2005, an attack by Xiaoyun Wang, Yiqun Lisa Yin, and Hongbo Yu was announced. The attacks can find collisions in the full version of SHA-1, requiring fewer than 269 operations. (A brute-force search would require 280 operations.)
The authors write: ""In particular, our analysis is built upon the original differential attack on SHA-0, the near collision attack on SHA-0, the multiblock collision techniques, as well as the message modification techniques used in the collision search attack on MD5. Breaking SHA-1 would not be possible without these powerful analytical techniques."" The authors have presented a collision for 58-round SHA-1, found with 233 hash operations. The paper with the full attack description was published in August 2005 at the CRYPTO conference.
In an interview, Yin states that, ""Roughly, we exploit the following two weaknesses: One is that the file preprocessing step is not complicated enough; another is that certain math operations in the first 20 rounds have unexpected security problems.""On 17 August 2005, an improvement on the SHA-1 attack was announced on behalf of Xiaoyun Wang, Andrew Yao and Frances Yao at the CRYPTO 2005 Rump Session, lowering the complexity required for finding a collision in SHA-1 to 263. On 18 December 2007 the details of this result were explained and verified by Martin Cochran.Christophe De Cannière and Christian Rechberger further improved the attack on SHA-1 in ""Finding SHA-1 Characteristics: General Results and Applications,"" receiving the Best Paper Award at ASIACRYPT 2006. A two-block collision for 64-round SHA-1 was presented, found using unoptimized methods with 235 compression function evaluations. Since this attack requires the equivalent of about 235 evaluations, it is considered to be a significant theoretical break. Their attack was extended further to 73 rounds (of 80) in 2010 by Grechnikov. In order to find an actual collision in the full 80 rounds of the hash function, however, tremendous amounts of computer time are required. To that end, a collision search for SHA-1 using the distributed computing platform BOINC began August 8, 2007, organized by the Graz University of Technology. The effort was abandoned May 12, 2009 due to lack of progress.At the Rump Session of CRYPTO 2006, Christian Rechberger and Christophe De Cannière claimed to have discovered a collision attack on SHA-1 that would allow an attacker to select at least parts of the message.In 2008, an attack methodology by Stéphane Manuel reported hash collisions with an estimated theoretical complexity of 251 to 257 operations. However he later retracted that claim after finding that local collision paths were not actually independent, and finally quoting for the most efficient a collision vector that was already known before this work.Cameron McDonald, Philip Hawkes and Josef Pieprzyk presented a hash collision attack with claimed complexity 252 at the Rump Session of Eurocrypt 2009. However, the accompanying paper, ""Differential Path for SHA-1 with complexity O(252)"" has been withdrawn due to the authors' discovery that their estimate was incorrect.One attack against SHA-1 was Marc Stevens with an estimated cost of $2.77M(2012) to break a single hash value by renting CPU power from cloud servers. Stevens developed this attack in a project called HashClash, implementing a differential path attack. On 8 November 2010, he claimed he had a fully working near-collision attack against full SHA-1 working with an estimated complexity equivalent to 257.5 SHA-1 compressions. He estimated this attack could be extended to a full collision with a complexity around 261.


==== The SHAppening ====
On 8 October 2015, Marc Stevens, Pierre Karpman, and Thomas Peyrin published a freestart collision attack on SHA-1's compression function that requires only 257 SHA-1 evaluations. This does not directly translate into a collision on the full SHA-1 hash function (where an attacker is not able to freely choose the initial internal state), but undermines the security claims for SHA-1. In particular, it was the first time that an attack on full SHA-1 had been demonstrated; all earlier attacks were too expensive for their authors to carry them out. The authors named this significant breakthrough in the cryptanalysis of SHA-1 The SHAppening.The method was based on their earlier work, as well as the auxiliary paths (or boomerangs) speed-up technique from Joux and Peyrin, and using high performance/cost efficient GPU cards from NVIDIA. The collision was found on a 16-node cluster with a total of 64 graphics cards. The authors estimated that a similar collision could be found by buying US$2,000 of GPU time on EC2.The authors estimated that the cost of renting enough of EC2 CPU/GPU time to generate a full collision for SHA-1 at the time of publication was between US$75K and 120K, and noted that was well within the budget of criminal organizations, not to mention national intelligence agencies. As such, the authors recommended that SHA-1 be deprecated as quickly as possible.


==== SHAttered – first public collision ====
On 23 February 2017, the CWI (Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica) and Google announced the SHAttered attack, in which they generated two different PDF files with the same SHA-1 hash in roughly 263.1 SHA-1 evaluations. This attack is about 100,000 times faster than brute forcing a SHA-1 collision with a birthday attack, which was estimated to take 280 SHA-1 evaluations. The attack required ""the equivalent processing power of 6,500 years of single-CPU computations and 110 years of single-GPU computations"".


==== Birthday-Near-Collision Attack – first practical chosen-prefix attack ====
On 24 April 2019 a paper by Gaëtan Leurent and Thomas Peyrin presented at Eurocrypt 2019 described an enhancement to the previously best chosen-prefix attack in Merkle–Damgård–like digest functions based on Davies–Meyer block ciphers. With these improvements, this method is capable of finding chosen-prefix collisions in approximately 268 SHA-1 evaluations. This is approximately 1 billion times faster (and now usable for many targeted attacks, thanks to the possibility of choosing a prefix, for example malicious code or faked identities in signed certificates) than the previous attack's 277.1 evaluations (but without chosen prefix, which was impractical for most targeted attacks because the found collisions were almost random) and is fast enough to be practical for resourceful attackers, requiring approximately $100,000 of cloud processing. This method is also capable of finding chosen-prefix collisions in the MD5 function, but at a complexity of 246.3 does not surpass the prior best available method at a theoretical level (239), though potentially at a practical level (≤249). This attack has a memory requirement of 500+ GB.
On 5 January 2020 the authors published an improved attack. In this paper they demonstrate a chosen-prefix collision attack with a complexity of 263.4, that at the time of publication would cost 45k USD per generated collision.


=== Official validation ===

Implementations of all FIPS-approved security functions can be officially validated through the CMVP program, jointly run by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Communications Security Establishment (CSE). For informal verification, a package to generate a high number of test vectors is made available for download on the NIST site; the resulting verification, however, does not replace the formal CMVP validation, which is required by law for certain applications.
As of December 2013, there are over 2000 validated implementations of SHA-1, with 14 of them capable of handling messages with a length in bits not a multiple of eight (see SHS Validation List Archived 2011-08-23 at the Wayback Machine).

=== SHA-1 pseudocode ===
Pseudocode for the SHA-1 algorithm follows:

Note 1: All variables are unsigned 32-bit quantities and wrap modulo 232 when calculating, except for
        ml, the message length, which is a 64-bit quantity, and
        hh, the message digest, which is a 160-bit quantity.
Note 2: All constants in this pseudo code are in big endian.
        Within each word, the most significant byte is stored in the leftmost byte position

Initialize variables:

h0 = 0x67452301
h1 = 0xEFCDAB89
h2 = 0x98BADCFE
h3 = 0x10325476
h4 = 0xC3D2E1F0

ml = message length in bits (always a multiple of the number of bits in a character).

Pre-processing:
append the bit '1' to the message e.g. by adding 0x80 if message length is a multiple of 8 bits.
append 0 ≤ k < 512 bits '0', such that the resulting message length in bits
   is congruent to −64 ≡ 448 (mod 512)
append ml, the original message length in bits, as a 64-bit big-endian integer. 
   Thus, the total length is a multiple of 512 bits.

Process the message in successive 512-bit chunks:
break message into 512-bit chunks
for each chunk
    break chunk into sixteen 32-bit big-endian words w[i], 0 ≤ i ≤ 15

    Message schedule: extend the sixteen 32-bit words into eighty 32-bit words:
    for i from 16 to 79
        Note 3: SHA-0 differs by not having this leftrotate.
        w[i] = (w[i-3] xor w[i-8] xor w[i-14] xor w[i-16]) leftrotate 1

    Initialize hash value for this chunk:
    a = h0
    b = h1
    c = h2
    d = h3
    e = h4

    Main loop:
    for i from 0 to 79
        if 0 ≤ i ≤ 19 then
            f = (b and c) or ((not b) and d)
            k = 0x5A827999
        else if 20 ≤ i ≤ 39
            f = b xor c xor d
            k = 0x6ED9EBA1
        else if 40 ≤ i ≤ 59
            f = (b and c) or (b and d) or (c and d) 
            k = 0x8F1BBCDC
        else if 60 ≤ i ≤ 79
            f = b xor c xor d
            k = 0xCA62C1D6

        temp = (a leftrotate 5) + f + e + k + w[i]
        e = d
        d = c
        c = b leftrotate 30
        b = a
        a = temp

    Add this chunk's hash to result so far:
    h0 = h0 + a
    h1 = h1 + b 
    h2 = h2 + c
    h3 = h3 + d
    h4 = h4 + e

Produce the final hash value (big-endian) as a 160-bit number:
hh = (h0 leftshift 128) or (h1 leftshift 96) or (h2 leftshift 64) or (h3 leftshift 32) or h4

The number hh is the message digest, which can be written in hexadecimal (base 16).
The chosen constant values used in the algorithm were assumed to be nothing up my sleeve numbers:

The four round constants k are 230 times the square roots of 2, 3, 5 and 10. However they were incorrectly rounded to the nearest integer instead of being rounded to the nearest odd integer, with equilibrated proportions of zero and one bits. As well, choosing the square root of 10 (which is not a prime) made it a common factor for the two other chosen square roots of primes 2 and 5, with possibly usable arithmetic properties across successive rounds, reducing the strength of the algorithm against finding collisions on some bits.
The first four starting values for h0 through h3 are the same with the MD5 algorithm, and the fifth (for h4) is similar. However they were not properly verified for being resistant against inversion of the few first rounds to infer possible collisions on some bits, usable by multiblock differential attacks.Instead of the formulation from the original FIPS PUB 180-1 shown, the following equivalent expressions may be used to compute f in the main loop above:

Bitwise choice between c and d, controlled by b.
(0  ≤ i ≤ 19): f = d xor (b and (c xor d))                (alternative 1)
(0  ≤ i ≤ 19): f = (b and c) or ((not b) and d)           (alternative 2)
(0  ≤ i ≤ 19): f = (b and c) xor ((not b) and d)          (alternative 3)
(0  ≤ i ≤ 19): f = vec_sel(d, c, b)                       (alternative 4)
 [premo08]
Bitwise majority function.
(40 ≤ i ≤ 59): f = (b and c) or (d and (b or c))          (alternative 1)
(40 ≤ i ≤ 59): f = (b and c) or (d and (b xor c))         (alternative 2)
(40 ≤ i ≤ 59): f = (b and c) xor (d and (b xor c))        (alternative 3)
(40 ≤ i ≤ 59): f = (b and c) xor (b and d) xor (c and d)  (alternative 4)
(40 ≤ i ≤ 59): f = vec_sel(c, b, c xor d)                 (alternative 5)

It was also shown that for the rounds 32–79 the computation of:

w[i] = (w[i-3] xor w[i-8] xor w[i-14] xor w[i-16]) leftrotate 1

can be replaced with:

w[i] = (w[i-6] xor w[i-16] xor w[i-28] xor w[i-32]) leftrotate 2

This transformation keeps all operands 64-bit aligned and, by removing the dependency of w[i] on w[i-3], allows efficient SIMD implementation with a vector length of 4 like x86 SSE instructions.

Only one was produced but this machine continues to fly in a research program into laminar flow over wings.


== Design and development ==
The Leichflugtechnik-Union (LFU) was a consortium formed by the Bölkow, Pützer and Rhein-Flugzeugbau companies specifically to produce an aircraft built entirely of glass reinforced plastic (grp).  The result, the LFU 205 was one of the first all-grp light aircraft.The LFU 205 is a single-engined, low-winged monoplane of conventional appearance apart from slight, 7° forward sweep on the moderately tapered wing.  This carries Fowler flaps along the whole trailing edge inboard of the Frise ailerons.  The tail surfaces are also straight tapered, with the vertical surfaces slightly swept. The tailplane is a single piece, all moving surface. There are two pairs of side by side seats under a large curved, rearward sliding, canopy.  Fuselage and flying surfaces are monocoque structures using a grp sandwich with a smooth outer surface bonded to a corrugated inner skin, the latter formed from parallel 10 mm (0.4 in) tubes wrapped in glass fibre.  The corrugations run chordwise, rib-like, in the wings and tail and circumferentially in the fuselage.  The tail structures have a foam plastic core.It is powered by a flat 4-cylinder, 200 hp (150 kW) Lycoming IO-360 engine and has a tricycle undercarriage with inward retracting main legs and an aft retracting nosewheel.  The first flight was on 29 March 1968.


== Operational history ==
The LFU 205 was intended as an experimental aircraft and only one was built.  The initial flying programme was to test the constructional methods.  Since 1984 it has flown with the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) at Brunswick, Germany. It has been used in a research program into laminar flow aerofoils by fitting a ""glove"" of the new profile over the wings of the LFU 205 in the central sections inboard of the ailerons on both sides.  One prime interest is in the transition region between laminar and turbulent flow, studied using infra-red imaging.  The gloved regions are also instrumented to gain data on pressure and drag distributions and boundary layer behaviour.

== Early life ==
Clarke was the eldest son of Sir Edward Clarke of St. Vedast's, London, Lord Mayor of London, and his second wife Jane Clutterbuck, daughter of Richard Clutterbuck. He was admitted at  St Catharine's College, Cambridge on 20 March 1689 and at Middle Temple on 17 March 1690. He married Elizabeth Pinfold, daughter of Alexander Pinfold of Hoxton, Middlesex on. 9 January 1699.  Clarke may be the ‘Thomas Clerk’ who was named with his brother-in-law, Maynard Colchester  as one of the founding members of the Society of the Propagation of the Gospel in 1701. They  had  both been educated at the Middle Temple and shared an interest in landscape gardening. In 1703 he succeeded his father to Brickendon, and assumed the role of  a county country gentleman. In 1704 he became Freeman of Hertford. He carried out charitable works in his neighbourhood among which he ‘built a gallery in the church, set up chimes in the steeple, put  90 poor children to school, gave bibles, catechisms etc, and distributed half-peck loaves and two oxen among the poor at Christmas’.


== Career ==
Clarke probably met William Cowper, at Middle Temple. Soon after coming of age he stood for Parliament at Hertford at the 1705 general election on the  Cowper interest. Though defeated in the poll, he petitioned and was seated as a Whig Member of Parliament on 6 December 1705. In the House, he supported the Government, in February 1706, on the ‘place clause’ of the regency bill but made little other impression in the House. After presenting an address from his borough congratulating the Queen on the Duke of Marlborough's victory, he was knighted on 24 July 1706.  He was called to  the bar in 1706 and became an practicing lawyer. He was re-elected MP for Hertford at the 1708 general election and was appointed Commissioner for Charitable Uses at Hertford.  He was listed as a Whig, and during the 1708 Parliament he followed the party line, supporting the naturalization of the Palatines in 1709. He was a teller for committing the bill for restraining buildings on new foundations on 10 March 1709 and voted for the impeachment of Sacheverell in 1710.  He was defeated by the resurgent Tory interest at the 1710 general election and again in 1713.Clarke regained his seat at Hertford after the Hanoverian succession. At the 1715 general election he was again defeated in the poll but seated on petition on 24 May 1715. He generally acted with the government. For the third time at the 1722 general election he was defeated at the poll and seated on petition on 22 January 1723. In 1723 he became a bencher of his Inn. He was returned unopposed at the  1727 general election. He supported the Government, except on the civil list arrears in 1729 and on the later stages of the excise bill, having originally voted for it.  In 1731 he became Treasurer of his Inn. He was returned unopposed for Hertford again in  1734 but retired at the 1741 general election.


== Death and legacy ==
Clarke died without issue on 26 October 1754, and  left his estate to his niece Jane Morgan, wife of Thomas Morgan of Ruperra, Glamorgan.

== Course ==
The framework focuses on computational thinking practices which are applied throughout the curriculum. The concept outline included in the curriculum is divided into seven units called ""Big Ideas"". Each unit contains a series of ""Learning Objectives"". Each ""Learning Objective"" is a general benchmark of student performance or understanding which has an associated ""Enduring Understanding"". An ""Enduring Understanding"" is a core comprehension which students should retain well after completing the course. Each ""Learning Objective"" is split into multiple ""Essential Knowledge"" standards, which are specific facts or content which the student must know to demonstrate mastery of the  learning objective when assessed.

Game Workers Unite seeks to organize a trade union for video game developers to improve working conditions. Their activists are largely anonymous game developers from both indie and major firms. The group's flat organization eschews leaders and coordinates through Discord and Facebook. Their goal is a single union for all developers, including programmers, artists, designers, and producers, with subgroups within the union representing disciplines. In Australia, where the industry is smaller, Game Workers Unite wants to include esports professionals and marketing staff as well. They have argued that working conditions will only improve when studio managers are forced, and that workers cannot wait for managers to set realistic deadlines, fairer hiring practices, and to keep those promises. They also seek to show the emphasize the humans and conditions behind the making of games and have argued that, allied with consumers, workers can fight business practices that concern gamers, such as gambling-based gameplay mechanics.Some of the largest issues motivating the industry's organizing efforts include crunch time, when developers work overtime to finish a project in its last weeks, and social issues such as diversity and inclusion in the predominantly white and male industry.


== History ==

Game Workers Unite was at the center of a 2018 push for video game industry unionization. In March 2018, the collective evolved from a private game developers Facebook Group to a Discord server where over 100 games industry members congregated. The group's website soon collected 200 pledges of support to unionize the games industry. Their first action was to distribute informational materials at the Game Developers Conference later that month. The results were a turning point for pro-union momentum in the industry. Following a panel on arguments for and against unionization at the conference, developers expressed interest in unionization on social media. Within a few weeks, Game Workers Unite was officially founded and its membership quickly rose from less than 10 to about 300. Membership was about 600 by November 2018, and in the thousands across over 20 international chapters by mid-2019, including cities such as Los Angeles, Montreal, North Carolina, San Francisco, and Vancouver. The group keeps its members' employers private, has no official membership count, and does not announce its nascent campaigns, though at least 12 were in progress as of late 2018. Game Workers Unite's protest badges and pamphlets became quickly visible at developer expositions worldwide. Variety named the Game Workers Unite organizers and Emma Kinema (the group's most public figure) among the most influential people in video games in 2018, and by the March 2019 Game Developers Conference, AFL–CIO representation began outreach with video game workers.When considering its strategy, the group first met with media unions such as the Writers Guild of America and Screen Actors Guild before reaching out to smaller games communities. They hoped to build relationships with established unions and local developer communities before expanding to the global industry and collaborating with groups like the International Game Developers Association. The group saw the breadth and volume of roles in the games industry as posing potential difficulty for a single union strategy. The workplaces affiliated with Game Workers Unite campaigns include those with less than 100 and those with thousands. Some are working in conjunction with labor unions and others are working only with Game Workers Unite. The group also advocates for worker cooperatives.Kinema helped to organize the May 2019 walkout at Riot Games over its handling of sex discrimination. After employees attended a 2018 Game Workers Unite meeting, Kinema helped them create an organizing committee and advised the walkout organizers via phone. The company announced that it would retain its forced arbitration policy but would create a diversity and inclusion group. The organizers are working towards a worker-led group for rectifying burnout and overwork. The Communications Workers of America hired Kinema in early 2020 to organize workers in the video game and tech industries, the first such American union-sanctioned initiative in those sectors, launching the Campaign to Organize Digital Employees.Game Workers Unite's other actions have included a social media campaigns to fire CEOs presiding over layoffs, such as Activision's Bobby Kotick and ArenaNet's Mike O'Brien. The group retracted their campaign on the latter based on his employee and fan support. Game Workers Unite issued a statement calling attention to the disparity in job security across game worker roles, with developers and artists generally safe while quality assurance testers and event organizers were being laid off and furloughed.The group's British chapter, Game Workers Unite UK, became a legally recognized union within the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain in December 2018. Their four goals are ending unpaid overtime, bettering diversity and inclusion, educating and promoting targeted workers, and establishing steady and fair wages. It was the country's first games industry union. Game Workers Unite Toronto partnered with Communication Workers of America in early 2020. Game Workers Unite Australia will become a union under Professionals Australia in 2022.

== Early life ==
Sadykh bey Aghabekov was born on March 15, 1865 in Goychay city of the Baku Governorate. In 1883, he graduated from the Baku Realny School, after which he enrolled to the 2nd Konstantinovskoe Military School in St. Petersburg.


== Military career ==
In 1886, Aghabekov began service in Caucasus with the rank of podporuchik. Ten years later, in 1896, successfully passing the exams, he was admitted to the St. Petersburg Institute of Oriental Languages at the General Staff. After graduating from this institute, in 1899 he was sent to Turkestan for further military service. In 1913, Sadykh bey retired from army in the rank of major general due to illness. At the time of his military service in Turkestan, as a scientist-orientalist, he was collecting folk tales, epics and legends. As a result of titanic work, Sadykh bey published textbook ""Turkmen dialect"" for which the Emir of Bukhara awarded him a special diploma.
After retiring from the active military duty, Sadykh bey was confident that his military career ended and he would spend the rest of his life in his native Goychay. But after beginning of World War I, he returned to the army and fought in battles in Caucasus and then on the Ukrainian front. In 1916, Aghabekov bey returned to his homeland and lived in his house in Goychay.

He noted in his speech that Sadig Bey is a man of high intellectual potential, and he has never met such a highly educated and interesting man among the military. His term lasted until December 1919. Sadykh bey was a reformer of law enforcement system in Azerbaijan.


== Later years ==
After occupation of Azerbaijan, Sadykh bey emigrated to Turkey with his family. He then moved to Paris, where he taught Turkish and Persian at the Sorbonne for 2 years. In Paris, he had another strike of fate - death of his wife Gulnara.After death of his wife, at the invitation of Zygmunt Smogorzewski he moved to Lviv where he started to work in Faculty of Philosophy in Lviv University and later in Lviv High Trade School, where he taught Turkish, Persian, and Arabic. In 1931 Sadykh bey published his Turkish textbook in Polish. In 1932, he published textbook about elementary grammar of Arabic, which had been written on the base of the second edition of the New Arabic Grammar by Auguste Périer. During the Nazi occupation, he was evicted from his apartment. In 1943, he felt ill and on October 9, 1944 he died.Aghabekov was buried in Lviv in Lychakiv Cemetery. One of Lviv streets was named in honor of Sadykh bey Agabekov. There is a tombstone on his grave in the Lviv cemetery.

== Plot ==
Days after the National Guard quarantines the neighborhood into a Safe Zone, residents try to resume life normally, though tensions build under the military rule. A perimeter fence is erected around the neighborhood, and citizens are subjected to strict curfews and regular health monitoring. Madison grows stressed by extra work in taking care of her overcrowded home, while Travis takes on a new role as civilian liaison. Chris begins to document the ongoing events using a video camera; while filming atop the house roof one afternoon, he notices what appears to be a light flashing repeatedly from a window located in the uninhabitable ""Dead Zone"" outside the fence. Believing it may be a signal from someone alive, he shows the video to Travis, who dismisses it and discourages Chris from investigating any further; undeterred, Chris then shows it to Madison, who seems more receptive but still discourages him from investigating.
One of the neighbors, Doug, begins to refuse the mandatory medical inspections; the leader of the troops, Lieutenant Moyers, orders Travis to try to convince Doug to comply. Travis succeeds and Doug agrees to comply, but a few days later, Doug is discovered to be missing from his house, along with his car. His family panics and seeks help from Travis, but Moyers informs him that Doug was found inside his car near the perimeter fence, and was taken into custody. Travis tells Moyers about the flashing light that Chris claims to have seen, but Moyers dismisses it, and assures Travis that all the buildings outside of the Safe Zone were investigated and found empty. Meanwhile, Liza tries to help injured and sick neighbors using her medical experience; Nick begins to steal morphine from one of her patients, Hector, via an IV drip, despite his claims to have kicked his dependency. When Hector is moved to a military hospital for further treatment, Nick begins to succumb to withdrawal symptoms again; Madison discovers him rifling through drawers looking for drugs, infuriating her. Meanwhile, Ofelia begins to flirt with one of the soldiers, Corporal Adams, in the hopes that he can acquire more medication for Griselda, though he has been unsuccessful so far.
One evening, Madison climbs onto the roof with a flashlight and exchanges signals with the light in the Dead Zone, leading her to believe that someone might be alive out there. She sneaks outside the fence to investigate and finds evidence that the Guardsmen killed civilians, including many uninfected. She returns to camp and mentions this to Daniel, who describes his experience in El Salvador during an illness outbreak, when the sick were taken by the military under the guise of receiving hospitalization but were instead executed. A new military doctor arrives at the camp, Dr. Exner, who quickly determines that Liza has lied about her experience as a nurse; however, because Liza does seem knowledgeable in medicine, and due to general lack of medical staff, Exner requests that Liza joins medical staff at a nearby military hospital. During a medical inspection, Exner advises that Griselda be taken to the military hospital to have her wounds be properly treated; Griselda agrees to go only if Daniel can join her, which Exner accepts. When soldiers arrive to pick them up, however, they state that Daniel is not permitted to go with her, but that they will be taking Nick; he tries to run away but is unsuccessful, and is forcefully loaded into a truck and taken away, despite protests from his family. Soon after, Liza voluntarily leaves on another truck, revealing that she accepted Exner's earlier offer, though she is reluctant about having to leave Chris behind. Later that night, Travis climbs up to the roof and sees the signal from the Dead Zone. Moments later, however, he sees and hears gunfire coming from the same window, followed by darkness.


== Reception ==
""Not Fade Away"" received very positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it garnered an 86% rating with an average score of 6.59/10 based on 24 reviews. The site consensus reads: ""'Not Fade Away' presents an overall gripping look at a society staring into the abyss, even if it would benefit from characters with greater depth.""Matt Fowler of IGN gave ""Not Fade Away"" a 7.8/10 rating stating: ""Fear the Walking Dead changed things up dramatically during its first season by skipping ahead and time and placing our characters in an army-occupied neighborhood. And while the threat of a crumbling military, who may operating on orders to overreact, is a great hook, the show still gets bogged down in familial bickering. Two of the best moments in 'Not Fade Away' involved characters exploding because they couldn't take the same inane BS. Alicia actually yelled at Travis and Madison for getting caught up in petty nonsense. And then later, Madison smacked up Nick for being the same fool addict he's always been, despite the entire country falling apart. Right then, in these moments, these characters were us.""


=== Ratings ===
""Not Fade Away"" was seen by 6.62 million viewers in the United States on its original air date, nearly half a million less than the previous episode.

This includes but is not limited to: liquid cargo transfer pumps, liquid cargo stripping pumps, liquid cargo coalesces and separators, strainers, filters, associated piping, valves, fittings, and deck machinery directly related to the transfer of liquid cargo.


== Maintenance ==
The pumpman's job is to keep the liquid cargo system on a tanker running.  The liquid cargo system consists of several components.  A major component is the pumps themselves, including not only the liquid cargo transfer pumps but also the liquid cargo stripping pumps.  Another component consists of the equipment that conditions the cargo, including liquid cargo coalescers and separators, strainers, and filters.  The third component consists of all the piping, valves, fittings, and deck machinery directly related to the transfer of liquid cargo.
The pumpman's job has three aspects: repairing equipment when it breaks, monitoring equipment to ensure it is working, and maintaining equipment to prevent breakage.  Many organizations, such as the United States Navy use planned- and preventive-maintenance systems to guide the pumpman in identifying and scheduling required maintenance  actions.Some common activities include rebuilding valves pumps and correcting leaks in the cargo system.  Pumpmen also often repack valves and glands.  Pumpmen also spend a lot of time lubricating parts, such as glands, bearings and reach rods.On some ships, pumpmen are responsible for the ballast system, room heating systems, and other engine department duties.


== General duties ==
Those that work aboard ships have general duties, in addition to their job-specific duties.  For the pumpman, this largely translates to proficiency during drills and actual emergencies.  The pumpman will participate in shipboard drills such as engineering casualty drills, fire drills, and collision drills, and must be able to perform assigned duties and carry out instructions safely and efficiently.  As a non-entry level rating, the pumpman is expected to take the initiative in emergencies without specific orders or instructions, and have a complete knowledge of safety policies and practices.  Some policies that are particularly important to the pumpman rating include handling of flammable/dangerous liquids, confined space entry procedures, and the ship's tag-out program.


== Working conditions ==
Merchant mariners spend extended periods at sea.  Most deep-sea mariners are hired for one or more voyages that last for several months; there is no job security after that.  The length of time between voyages varies depending on job availability and personal preference.At sea, a pumpman will usually work 8- to 12-hour days, 7 days a week.People in water transportation occupations work in all weather conditions.  Although merchant mariners try to avoid
severe storms while at sea, working in damp and cold conditions often is inevitable.  While it is uncommon nowadays for vessels to suffer disasters such as fire, explosion, or a sinking, workers face the possibility that they may have to abandon their craft on short notice if it collides with other vessels or runs aground.  They also risk injury or death from falling overboard and hazards associated with working with machinery, heavy loads, and dangerous cargo.  However, modern safety management procedures, advanced emergency communications, and effective international rescue systems place modern mariners in a much safer position.Most newer vessels are air conditioned, soundproofed from noisy machinery, and equipped with comfortable living quarters.  For some mariners, these amenities have helped ease the sometimes difficult circumstances of long periods away from home.  Also, modern communications, especially email, link modern mariners to their families.  Nevertheless, some mariners dislike the long periods away from home and the confinement aboard ship and consequently leave the occupation.In the United States, the rate of unionization for these workers is about 36 percent, much higher than the average for all occupations. Consequently, merchant marine officers and seamen, both veterans and beginners, are hired for voyages through union hiring halls or directly by shipping companies. Hiring halls rank the candidates by the length of time the person has been out of work and fill open slots accordingly. Hiring halls typically are found in major seaports.Pumpmen employed on Great Lakes ships work 60 days and have 30 days off, but do not work in the winter when the lakes are frozen. Workers on rivers, on canals, and in harbors are more likely to have year-round work.  Some work 8-hour or 12-hour shifts and go home every day.  Others work steadily for a week or a month and then have an extended period off. When working, they usually are on duty for 6 or 12 hours and off for 6 or 12 hours. Those on smaller vessels are normally assigned to one vessel and have steady employment.

== Plot ==
Count Alucard is invited by Katherine Caldwell to the United States. Caldwell is one of the daughters of New Orleans plantation owner Colonel Caldwell. Shortly after his arrival, the Colonel dies of an apparent heart failure and leaves his wealth to his two daughters. Claire receives all his money and Katherine his estate ""Dark Oaks"". Katherine has been secretly dating Alucard and the two are quickly married. Her former long-time boyfriend Frank Stanley confronts the couple and tries to shoot Alucard. The bullets pass through the Count's body and hit Katherine. Assuming she is dead, a shocked Frank runs off to get Dr. Brewster to attend to her. On the doctor's arrival, he is greeted by Alucard and a living Katherine. The couple instruct him that they will be devoting their days to scientific research and only welcome visitors at night. Frank goes on to the police and confesses to the murder of Katherine. Brewster tries to convince the Sheriff that he saw Katherine alive, but the Sheriff insists on searching Dark Oaks. He finds Katherine's dead body and has her transferred to the morgue. Dr. Brewster is shown reading the novel Dracula.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Professor Lazlo arrives at Brewster's house. Brewster has noticed that Alucard is Dracula spelled backwards and Lazlo suspects vampirism. A local boy brought to Brewster's house confirms this suspicion—there are bite marks on his neck. Later, the Count appears to Brewster and Lazlo but is driven away by a cross. Katherine sneaks into Frank's cell and explains that she only married Alucard (who is really Dracula himself) to obtain immortality and wants to share it with Frank. He is initially repulsed by her idea, but then yields to her. After she explains that she has already drunk some of his blood, she advises him on how to destroy Alucard. He breaks out of prison, seeks out Alucard's hiding place and burns his coffin. Without his daytime sanctuary, Alucard is destroyed when the sun rises. Brewster, Lazlo, and the Sheriff arrive at the scene to find Alucard's remains.
Meanwhile, Frank stumbles into the playroom where Katherine said she would be. He finds her coffin and gazes down at her lifeless body. Knowing he must kill the love of his life, Frank takes off his ring and puts it on Katherine's left ring finger. Once Brewster and the others reach the room, they see Frank appear at the door. He steps back allowing them to follow. As they enter the room, they see Katherine's burning coffin. They all stare, speechlessly, while Frank mourns the loss of his love.

=== Development and pre-production ===
Son of Dracula was the third ""Dracula"" film produced by Universal, following the 1936 film Dracula's Daughter. Within three weeks of the premier of Tod Browning's Dracula (1931), Universal presented three titles for follow-ups to the Hays Office. These included The Modern Dracula, The Return of Dracula and The Son of Dracula. No notes exist regarding the possible story content of any for these films. Son of Dracula was prepared under different standards at Universal than the previous two films. The company had only restarted production on horror films in 1938 with the film Son of Frankenstein (1939) and Universal's Chairman of the Board J. Cheever Cowdin had been heavily involved in the formation of the company.  Profits at Universal by 1941 has been higher than they had been in 1940 while a double bill of both Dracula and Frankenstein (1931) in early 1942 was declared to have ""staggeringly good business"" in the Motion Picture Herald. Following these events, the Daily Variety announced on June 5 that two new horror films were announced with Lon Chaney, Jr.: Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man (1943) and Son of Dracula.Curt Siodmak was commissioned to write a script for the film in May 1942. By June 8, the Los Angeles Times announced that Curt Siodmak was still writing the screenplay. Curt Siodmak's previous work was deeply rooted in horror and science fiction, from the original novel and screenplay for F.P.1 (1932) and screenplays in Hollywood for Black Friday (1940), The Invisible Man Returns (1940), The Ape (1940), The Wolf Man (1941), and Invisible Agent (1942). On July 24, the Motion Picture Herald announced that Universal had purchased Siodmak's finished draft of the script. The Daily Variety noted that  Eric Taylor was given the task of writing the final script. Taylor had worked previously on Black Friday with Siodmak as well as on Phantom of the Opera (1943) and The Ghost of Frankenstein. In a 1984 interview with Tom Weaver, Curt Siodmak said that after his brother Robert Siodmak was hired as the film's director, he made his brother leave the project. Curt explained that the two ""had a sibling rivalry. When we were in Germany, Robert had a magazine and when I wrote for it, I had to change my name. he only wanted one Siodmak around. This lasted 71 years, until he died."" In his book on Son of Dracula's production history, Gary D. Rhodes suggested that Curt might have been wrong about this specific situation as there was no indication that Robert was hired as the director when Taylor was hired for the script. Weaver suggested that the film took place outside the universe of Dracula (1931) and Dracula's Daughter (1936). Weaver noted that in Son of Dracula, Prof. Lazlo states that Count Dracula was destroyed in the 19th century making it not follow the story of the two previously mentioned films. Weaver also highlighted a pressbook article that stated that ""Although Son of Dracula is not a 'continuation' of [the 1931 Dracula], it is based mainly on the same ghoulish legend of the vampire""Outside of Chaney, Louise Allbritton was cast as Katherine with her role being announced by Universal on January 7. This date lead to Rhodes suggesting that she was cast at the very last minute. Based on press accounts, Evelyn Ankers was cast as Claire before most actors other than Chaney. Ankers had previously acted in other Universal features including Hold That Ghost (1941), The Wolf Man, The Ghost of Frankenstein, Captive Wild Woman (1943) and The Mad Ghoul (1943). Universal announced that Frank Craven and J. Edward Bromberg had been cast on January 12, 1943.


=== Production ===
On July 14, 1942 the initial announcements for production was set to start in September. The Hollywood Reporter later announced in December 1942 that production would start on January 4, 1943. To meet this deadline, Universal sent a new draft of the script to the Production Code Administration (PCA) on December 29 with a script titled Destiny for approval. The response dated December 31 stated that this current script would not be approved by the PCA, leading to another script sent on January 4, 1943 which delayed the films production. Production began on Son of Dracula on January 7.George Waggner was originally set to be the associate producer on the film, but became too sidetracked by Phantom of the Opera. He was replaced with Ford Beebe in mid-January. Beebe had previously co-directed the film serials Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars (1938), Buck Rogers (1939), The Phantom Creeps (1939), Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe (1940), as well as feature films such as Night Monster (1942). He would also be the film's second unit director. A casting change was made on set, as Alan Curtis originally had the role of Frank but was replaced by Robert Paige after Curtis suffered a knee injury while filming the final scenes of Flesh and Fantasy (1943). According to Rhodes, few details about the production of Son of Dracula survive in the form of studio files or trade reports. Production on the film ended on February 2.Robert Siodmak, then on a $150 a week contract, said he was reluctant to take the film; he called the script ""terrible—it had been knocked together in a few days"". He stated he was persuaded to take the job by his wife, who said if he showed he was ""a little bit better"" than Universal's other directors, it would impress the studio. Three days into shooting, he was offered a seven-year contract. ""We did a lot of rewriting and the result wasn't bad,"" he said, ""it wasn't good but some scenes have a certain quality.""The film was edited by Saul A. Goodkind. Goodkind had worked with Beebe as an editor on  Flash Gordon and Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars. Rhodes commented again that little is known about the post-production of the film; he noted that only minor changes in dialogue beyond what is written in the final shooting script are present in the finished film.


== Release ==
Son of Dracula was held back from release for about six months before its premiere in the United States. The Motion Picture Herald had the film listed as being among the 162 features Hollywood Studios had yet to assign a release date in their February 27, 1943 issue. Discussing the film's release, Robert J. Kiss hypothesized that they delay was related to war films that generally needed to be accommodated into release to retain their topicality, as the United States had entered into World War II. Prior to its release in the United States, the film was released at Cine Olimpia in Mexico City on October 20, 1943. It was released with a Spanish-language dub as El hijo de Dracula on the top half of a double feature with Captive Wild Woman. Another screening took place in Canada on November 1, 1943 for a three-day run at the Capitol Theatre in Brandon, Manitoba.Son of Dracula and The Mad Ghoul had been put into late night midnight screenings on October 30 in small towns in cities in the United States. For instance, it was screened at the Tivoli Theatre in Maryville, Missouri and the Parks Theatre in Cedar City, Utah. Most trade presses declared the screening at the Rialto in New York City on November 5 as the premiere, although the theatre did not bill the engagement as such. At the Rialto, the film was held over from its initial two week booking into a fourth week, with the film grossing $11,000 in its first week. In the November 11, 1944 issue of the trade magazine Boxoffice, a report showed the first-run performances of 336 features released between the third quarter of 1943 and mid-year 1944 from 22 major American cities. Ticket sales for Son of Dracula were 23% above average sales and declared a hit by the publication. It was Universal's best-performing film in either the horror or science fiction genres during this period. In comparison, Universal's Jungle Woman (1944) and The Invisible Man's Revenge  (1944) performed  14% and 13% above average respectively. Meanwhile, The Mummy's Ghost (1943) and The Mad Ghoul (1944) were 5% above average and 2% below average respectively. Comparing the film to non-Universal outings in the genre, the film did not do as well as 20th Century Fox's The Lodger (1944) or Paramount Pictures' The Uninvited (1944), had the same average as RKO's The Ghost Ship (1943), and beat Columbia's The Return of the Vampire. Outside of large cities, bookings for Son of Dracula lasted for two or three days which was the standard practice of the period.Son of Dracula was first reissued theatrically in 1948. In August 1951, Realart Pictures released Son of Dracula as parts of its ""7 Days of Horror"" package, which featured 14 Universal films over the course of a week. The film was also part of Screen Gems' Shock! package of 52 pre-1948 Universal feature films released to television in October 1957.  It was first shown on television in 1957; by October 1958, Son of Dracula has played on television stations across America. Son of Dracula was first released on VHS and Betamax in 1988. It was released on DVD as part of the Dracula: The Legacy Collection and the Monster Legacy Collection in April 2004 and on Blu-ray on May 16, 2017 as part of the Dracula: Complete Legacy Collection set.Shown on the MeTV show Svengoolie on March 12, 2022.


== Reception ==
Rhodes declared that initial critical reception to Son of Dracula was ""varied"". From contemporary reviews, The Hollywood Reporter declared that Son of Dracula was ""a topline entry"" as a horror film as it was ""well made"" with ""intelligent direction by Robert Siodmak"" and that ""Chaney's Dracula is an outstanding job, accomplished without the gobs of makeup with which he is generally smeared."" Irene Thirer of The New York Post ranked the film as ""Fair to good"",  finding it ""is neatly turned out [...] and is certainly guaranteed for goose-pimples—and we might add, laughs."" A. H. Weiler of The New York Times found the film as ""unintentionally funny as it is chilling"" and concluded it a ""pretty pallid offering."" A review in Harrison's Reports noted that Son of Dracula was ""extremely weird, fantastic, and morbid, but because the theme has been done many times, it fails to attain the terrifying impact of the original.""In their book Universal Horrors, Weaver, Michael Brunas and John Brunas stated that Son of Dracula is ""often lumped together with the rest of the Universal monster pictures of the '40s in the early years of horror scholarship, it has incrementally been seen as the product of a more sophisticated mindset."" and in the canon of Robert Siodmak's career, ""Son of Dracula was ""still regarded as a footnote, a stepping stone to his later highly regarded film noir works."" Bob Mastrangelo of AllMovie referred to the film as ""strictly minor-league, harmless entertainment that never reaches its potential"", finding Chaney was ""not doing a very good job"" but that ""the problems with Son of Dracula are beyond Chaney, as the script never really takes advantage of the juicy potential of the story and lacks the dark humor and beautiful atmospherics that make the best Universal horror films so timeless"". Sean Axmaker wrote in The Seattle Times that Son of Dracula was a ""moody minor horror gem"" that was held back by ""clumsy antics of the skeptical cops and the plodding exposition spouted by an old Carpathian doctor"".In an interview with Starlog magazine in 1990, Curt Siodmak reflected on Son of Dracula stating that the film ""became a classic through Robert [Sidomak]'s handling of light and shadow. He was wonderful on mood, characterization, atmosphere, the psychology. He could make marvelous scenes. But he couldn't write.""

Following a bank robbery in the American west, the partner of Scottish outlaw Arch Deans is killed and his young Indian half breed friend Billy Two Hats is captured.
While Billy is being transported, Deans gets the drop on Sheriff Henry Gifford at a remote trading post, enabling Billy to escape. As they flee, the sheriff's friend, the trading post owner, named Copeland, takes down his old long-range buffalo rifle and fires a shot that kills Deans' horse, breaking his leg. Billy builds a travois on which Deans can ride, dragged behind Billy's horse. Deans and Billy encounter trouble on the trail, four Indians demand whiskey from them but Billy talks their way out of it.
Billy and Deans encounter Spencer and his wife, Esther, at their remote homestead. Deans persuades Spencer to take him in his wagon to get horses on the condition that Billy stay with Esther to protect her and the homestead from marauding Indians. Billy is also to keep a look out for the pursuing Gifford.
Billy and Esther spend their time together talking and develop romantic feelings for each other. Esther, a young mail-order bride from the East, is unhappy with her older abusive husband. She falls in love with the young good looking Billy. Gifford finds the two in bed together, assumes Billy raped the woman, becomes enraged, and beats him. Esther attempts to explain but can't because she stutters uncontrollably when distressed.
Deans and Spencer encounter trouble on the trail, the four Indians who demanded whiskey from Deans and Billy earlier, ambush their wagon in a canyon, killing the horse and besiege them. Spencer is killed.
Gifford, Esther and Billy then set out after Deans. They find Deans near death. With Esther's help Billy kills Gifford. Deans dies of his wounds. Not believing in burying the dead, Billy places his body in a tree atop a hill, Indian fashion. He and Esther ride off together.

== Reception ==
Variety called the film ""a fresh, different oater (the first filmed in Israel) that opens with violence and contains some throughout but never lingers lovingly on mayhem and gore; ergo, it's tame for the Sam Peckinpah bunch, but so well handled in every way it should have a good future both here and abroad."" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 2 stars out of 4 and wrote, ""When the action turns, as inevitably it must, to conversation between Peck and Arnaz, 'Billy Two Hats' becomes vapid. And when young Arnaz strikes up a romance with a rancher's stuttering mail-order bride, the action and dialog become positively embarrassing."" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote, ""Writer Alan Sharp's characters are all well-drawn and well-acted, but 'Billy Two Hats'' pacing is too languid and its style too portentous to sustain interest in them."" John Raisbeck of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote, ""Like Ulzana's Raid, also written by Alan Sharp, Billy Two Hats is a film of hunters and hunted, centring on the father/son relationship; only here the traditional roles are reversed, with the grizzled Deans (Gregory Peck wrestling unsuccessfully with a Scottish accent) having to lean on his resourceful young companion. The motif, however, is handled with an obviousness which characterises much of the film.""

== Career as an artist ==

Caterina was the only woman included in Giovanni Battista Passeri's biography of contemporary artists and was one of a few women to become a member of the Accademia di San Luca. Passeri praised Caterina for her dedication to studying drawing and painting, rather than the usual women's pastimes of sewing. Her uncle Cardinal Ginnasi appreciated and encouraged her work; he displayed four of her paintings amongst works by Titian and Guido Reni in his gallery: a St Catherine with the wheel; an Assumption of the Virgin; St Michael Archangel and a Virgin with Velletri's protector saints. He also asked her to paint altarpieces for the church of Santa Lucia alle Botteghe Oscure in Rome and for his chapel in the cathedral of Velletri (now lost).Caterina's success in Rome was due to these religious altarpieces. The majority of her works were completed for the church of Santa Lucia alle Botteghe Oscure that had been rebuilt in 1630 under her uncle’s patronage; the church was destroyed in 1936, her altarpiece of the martyrdom of Saint Lucy and a lunette of the Last Supper (cut down from an altarpiece) are visible in a surviving photograph of the church; the altarpiece and lunette are now in the chapel and sacristy of the present Palazzo Ginnasi. The Saint Lucy altarpiece was designed by Lanfranco. Caterina also painted a small oval of the Virgin for this church, as well as an altarpiece of Saint Blaise healing a boy, whose face is said to be modelled on Cardinal Ginnasi.For the chapel in Velletri, Caterina painted a large altarpiece of the Virgin and Velletri's Four Protector Saints; two side paintings of saints; four corner Evangelists and the chapel's dome; these have been destroyed or repainted. She also painted the main altarpiece for the church of SS. dell'Angeli Custodi (demolished in 1928-1929 for the Via del Tritone) depicting a guardian angel leading a boy to Paradise away from Hell (now lost). A painting of Saint Joseph (untraced) was also recorded in Rome in 1925. A Nativity and Pieta were also recorded in an 18th-century collection. A portrait of Cardinal Ginnasi in the Podestà-Lucciardi Collection, Sarzana, has been attributed to Caterina; along with an oval version previously in the Castel Bolognese.


== Patronage ==
In 1637, Caterina persuaded her uncle Cardinal Ginnasi to found a convent of Discalced Carmelite nuns of the Corpus Domini which was built inside the family palace, Palazzo Ginnasi, and attached to the church of Santa Lucia alle Botteghe Oscure. The convent was run by Caterina and her mother, Faustina Gottardi. Caterina owned many religious images, particularly of Saint Catherine, relics, statuettes and wax images as well as objects believed to be magical. At his death in 1639, her uncle left her a large dowry which she invested and doubled in worth. She commissioned a tomb for her uncle from Giuliano Finelli.


== Legacy ==
Like her family, Caterina was interred in the church of S Lucia; however, in 1938 this church and convent were torn down during enlargement of the Via delle Botteghe Oscure. The Baroque funerary monuments of the family were transferred to a modern chapel inside the modern rebuilt Palazzo Ginassi. Caterina's inscription is translated as:
Caterina Ginnasi, nephew of Cardinal Ginnasi, because of her fruitful virtue, mother of the poor and married yet barren. She did not use the money on earth to purchase the profits from Heaven, but proferred it in charity towards all. In furnishings, in victuals, in lodging: in all, she only sought suffering for herself; and to live after death, she lived as if her residence were but a tomb. In the early morning in winter while attending the sacred functions, spurred by the heat of her divine love, she contracted a cold, and for this, she died, but her charity will never die.

== Career ==
Deacon was brought up by his English mother in Stoke Newington, Hackney. His father is reportedly Moroccan, though Deacon believes that he may have been Egyptian. His father walked out on the family when Deacon was two years old, and to this date the pair have never had any contact.Although his acting career began with guest appearances in Bill's New Frock, Shooters, Ali G Indahouse and The Bill, he also starred in the ITV drama Wall Of Silence in 2004.  Deacon's breakthrough came when he landed a starring role in the urban drama film Kidulthood. He then worked with Kidulthood writer Noel Clarke on a number of other projects until 2011, including the sequel Adulthood, 4.3.2.1. and the one-off television pilot West 10 LDN.Deacon co-wrote, co-directed and played the lead role in urban comedy Anuvahood. Following this, Time Out magazine labeled Deacon ""The New Face of Youth Cinema"". In February 2012, he won the BAFTA Rising Star Award.
Deacon has since appeared in many lead and supporting roles in feature films, including Bonded by Blood, Jack Falls, Shank, Everywhere and Nowhere and Payback Season. He had a guest role in Victim. In November 2012, he co-hosted the Music of Black Origin Awards telecast with Miquita Oliver where Deacon played a comical part in the awards. In May 2021, he appeared in an episode of the BBC soap opera Doctors as TK Nelson.


== Legal problems ==
In July 2015, he was found guilty of harassment without violence at West London Magistrates' Court, having had a highly publicised feud with Noel Clarke with accusations of Clarke bullying him and sabotaging Deacon's career, which Clarke stated was not true. On 20 July, Deacon was found guilty. The court, which heard that Deacon had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and had been self-medicating using skunk cannabis, banned Deacon from contacting Clarke again.On 7 April 2016, he was arrested after police were called to reports of a man reportedly armed with a machete style knife and threatening members of the public in London. He was unable to attend a hearing in March due to being ""in hospital for treatment for underlying mental health issues"". On 7 April, a jury delivered two not-guilty verdicts for affray and possessing an offensive weapon accepting Deacon was mentally ill and not criminally responsible for his actions.

It is a seawater fish and the type species of the genus Syngnathus.,"The greater pipefish (Syngnathus acus) is a pipefish of the family Syngnathidae. It is a seawater fish and the type species of the genus Syngnathus.


== Etymology ==
The genus name Syngnathus derives from the Greek, syn, symphysis meaning  grown together and gnathos meaning jaw. The Latin species name acus means needle.


== Description ==

The greater pipefish has a long segmented armoured body, angular in cross section and stretching up 45 cm long with its stiff appearance. It ranges a color brown to green in with broad alternating light and dark hue along it. Its customized by a long snout with mouth on end and a slight hump on the top of the body just behind the eyes.
The fish is generally 33 cm to 35 cm in length with a reported maximum length of 47 cm.  They are almost square in each segment of the body, and known to feel rigid when handled. The greater pipefish has distinctive body rings which are a sandy brown with darker bars covering his body in between.


== Anatomy ==
The anatomy of fish vary through the sex. The top third of the females belly is deep (when egg bound), twice the breadth of the lower two thirds below the vent. The male is the ""tailing"" with the twin folds below the vent. The folds of the skin make the middle third and during the ""brooding"" of the young they swell in size until the young are released from the pouch (at a size of 22 mm to 35 mm).


== Biology ==
These fishes feed on live mysids and small prawns. They are ovoviviparous and reproduce usually three times each year. A few females deposit partial clutches under the tail into the male's brood pouch, that may contain up to 400 eggs.


== Distribution ==
The greater pipefish is found all around the British Isles and is regularly found in the Mediterranean Sea.


== Habitat ==
These fishes are common on southerly and westerly coasts in a variety of habitats, often amongst seaweeds and seagrass.


== Syngnathus temminckii ==
The southern African species Syngnathus temminckii (Kaup, 1856) was until recently synonymised with S. acus. However, morphological data clearly show that it is distinct, and genetic data indicate that it is not even the sister taxon of S. acus, but of another southern African species, the river pipefish S. watermeyeri.

""Just Can't Get Enough"" became a hit of its own in the Netherlands in early 1985. It wasn't released as a separate single, so it was the 12"" single (L12Bong4) that entered the Dutch chart. Officially it wasn't allowed in the singles charts as the 12"" had been sold (and priced) as a mini-LP in the weeks before that. But due to its popularity on the radio, ""Just Can't Get Enough"" was allowed to enter and duly became Depeche Mode's biggest Dutch hit of all time.

== Youth football ==


=== Cambridge United Youth & Community Trust ===
George was integral in setting up the Cambridge United Youth & Community Trust, which was formed in March 2010 to provide sport and learning activities for children in Cambridge and the surrounding area. Its mission statement is ""to positively influence the lifetime potential of 10,000 children annually through sport"", which it seeks to achieve through operating football courses and a Centre of Excellence, alongside more traditional education courses which it runs out of its state of the art Learning Centre at the Abbey Stadium.As a result of his involvement with the Trust, and as manager of Cambridge Regional College, George became intimately involved with the financing of youth football. Because of its status as a non-league club, Cambridge United receives no funding from the Football League Youth Development scheme, despite its historical success in producing players for both its own first team, and other clubs; indeed, the club's youth system is regarded throughout professional football circles as one of the best in England. George's first fundraising venture saw him walk from Torquay to Cambridge to highlight the injustice in the funding rules which saw Torquay United receive £180,000 for their youth set-up following their victory over Cambridge United in the 2009 play-off final. The walk saw George, along with then centre of excellence manager Matt Walker, cover 260 miles and raise £40,000 to help towards the annual running costs of Cambridge's youth teams.


=== Protect Football's Future ===
Protect Football's Future was launched in April 2010 as a coalition between six former league clubs - Wrexham, Oxford United, York City, Rushden & Diamonds, Mansfield Town and Cambridge United - to oppose the FA's funding rules which they perceived as unfair and creating a postcode lottery. To publicise the launch, George undertook a 19-day, 410-mile walk in April and May 2010 from Wrexham to Wembley to raise funds and awareness of the campaign. During the so-called 'Walk for Change', close to 3,000 signatures were collected on a petition, with past and present Premier League players Dave Kitson, Danny Murphy, Curtis Davies and Jack Collison among those pledging support.The walk raised around £60,000 for youth development funds and garnered much media attention for the campaign, culminating in the presentation of the petition to the FA at Wembley, and an All Star Match at the Abbey Stadium. Dave Kitson, in particular, was a vocal supporter of George's campaign, appearing at the All Star Match, conducting various media interviews and (alongside Jack Collison and Curtis Davis) writing an open letter to the FA, Premier League and Football League supporting the need for changes to youth football's financing.In January 2011, George said of his campaign that ""some progress has been made but it’s a very slow process"". This followed meetings with Sir Trevor Brooking, the FA's director of football development and Jed Roddy, the Premier League's head of youth, to discuss the Protect Football's Future campaign.


== Managerial career ==


=== CRC FC ===
After joining Cambridge United from local rivals Cambridge City, George became the first manager of Cambridge Regional College, a team formed in 2006 as a de facto reserve team. FA rules prohibit reserve teams playing at certain levels of the football pyramid, and so the CRC name was adopted in recognition of the college's financial support, and because the team is made up almost entirely of scholars.George coached the team for a number of years to considerable success both on and off the field as it grew to establish itself in the Eastern Counties Football League, finishing runners-up in 2008–09 and again in 2009–10, producing a number of players who would go on to star in Cambridge's first team, notably Josh Coulson, Robbie Willmott and Luke Berry.


=== Cambridge United ===
When Martin Ling left Cambridge United on 1 February 2011 after 87 games in charge, George took over as caretaker manager of the first team, initially until the end of the 2010–11 season. After successfully guiding the team to safety from relegation, his position was made permanent at the end of the season.George set about reshaping the team prior to the 2011–12 season in order to meet budget cuts, which saw a 25% reduction in the club's playing budget. A number of the club's highest earners, including former assistant manager Paul Carden and the previous season's top scorer Danny Wright, left the club as George implemented a disciplined wage structure: ""the players who were over the wage ceiling...were quite categorically told the options they had to them were to take a pay cut and discuss what that would be or to find another club"".Despite the budget restraints, however, George enjoyed a successful start to the season with a team made up of CRC graduates and promising youngsters. Early season form saw the team establish itself in the play-off positions following notable away wins against Luton Town and Mansfield Town, both tipped for success prior to the start of the season. Such was the dramatic change in the mood around the club under George's management, attendances began to recover from the historic lows seen under the Ling-era, and fans coined the term 'the Jezolution', a portmanteau of George's forename and 'revolution', selling 'Viva La Jezolution' merchandise to continue George's legacy of fundraising from his youth football days. On 14 April 2012, George paid the ticket entry fee for each of the 80 Cambridge United fans who attended the club's away fixture at Barrow out of his own pocket. This generous act was George's way of thanking the club's fans for their loyal support throughout his first full year in charge, and was followed by the first team players on that day buying a large amount of pizzas for the away fans to eat on their 270-mile journey home. Cambridge United would finish the 2011–12 season in 9th place.
George led Cambridge United to two wins out of their first three league matches in the 2012–13 Conference National campaign. This strong start was followed by a run of eight games where they failed to win, only securing three draws. This poor run of form led George to announce his return to his previous role as Director of Football on 4 October 2012. At the same time, Richard Money was announced as the new head coach of Cambridge United. He was made Chief Executive Officer of Cambridge United in October 2014.

","Hapoel Kiryat Malakhi (Hebrew: הפועל קרית מלאכי) was an Israeli football club based in Kiryat Malakhi.


== History ==
The club was founded in 1954 and joined Liga Gimel at the 1954–55 season, the last season in which Liga Gimel was the third tier of Israeli football league system.
In 1959, the club was promoted to the new third tier, Liga Bet, after that league was expanded to 64 teams, divided in 4 divisions. However, the club's spell in Liga Bet lasted one season only, after they finished the 1959–60 season at the bottom of the South B division and dropped back to Liga Gimel.
In the 1963–64 season, the club won Liga Gimel South A division and made a return to Liga Bet, where they spent most of their football seasons, in the South B division. Hapoel were relegated to Liga Gimel at the end of the 1974–75 season, but made an immediate return to Liga Bet, which became the fourth tier, following the creation of Liga Artzit in 1976.
In the 1984–85 season, the club won Liga Bet South B division and achieved historic promotion to Liga Alef, where they spent 12 successive seasons at the South division, unable to achieve promotion to Liga Artzit. Hapoel were relegated to Liga Bet, after finished at bottom of the South division in the 1996–97 season. In the 1998–99 season, after major financial problems, the club withdrew after the 15th round, and had its results nullified, which resulted in automatic relegation to Liga Gimel, the lowest tier of Israeli football. After then mayor of Kiryat Malakhi, Lior Katzav, refused to fund an arbitration award against the club of 18,000 NIS, the Israel Football Association ceased the club's activity, and all the club's results for the 1999–2000 season were resulted in forfeit losses.

He also served as general secretary and then president of the MFGB. The new town of Peterlee was named after him.


== Biography ==
Peter Lee was born at Duff Heap Row, Fivehouses, Trimdon Grange, in July 1864, into a poor, but close-knit, family. Just ten years later, he was working ten-hour days at Littletown Colliery, Pittington, for a few pence a week, and by 21 he was a veteran of 15 pits.
His life, however, was not all work. He also had an enquiring mind and a love of books, inspired by his mother's regular reading sessions to the family. As he could not read himself, he took the brave step at the age of 20 to return to the classroom, to learn the basics from the beginning. He then headed for America in 1886 to improve himself still further, working in the mines of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Kentucky for two years.
After returning to England in 1888, Lee began work at Wingate pit, where he was elected as delegate to the Miners Conference. He was then elected as checkweighman at Wingate four years later, but gave up the role to travel to South Africa in 1896. He returned a changed man. Lee became a committed Christian following his travels and, although he continued to work down the mines, he also studied and preached in local Methodist chapels.
In 1900, at the age of 33, he returned to Wheatley Hill Colliery, where he became the checkweighman, and also stood for the parish council. His council duties involved responsibility for sanitation and water purity within the village, as well as the creation of new roads and a cemetery. He went on to be elected as chairman of the council, as well as chairman of the local Co-operative and chairman of Durham County Water Board.
By 1909, Lee was a member of Durham County Council and, ten years later, he was elected as the chairman of the authority. And, despite his many responsibilities, he also found time to serve as the agent of Durham Miners Association and President of the Miners’ Federation of Great Britain.
Although Peter Lee died in 1935, some years before the town of Peterlee was created, his name lives on both in the town and in Peter Lee Methodist Church. The Right Honourable Lord Lawson, the Lord Lieutenant of County Durham, paid tribute to Peter Lee in a souvenir brochure produced for the church in the 1950s, saying: “Peter Lee was a living witness to the power of religion in the life of a man, and he gave ample testimony to it. He gave all, asking nothing in return, little dreaming that a great New Town would bear his name.”
Peter Lee is buried in the cemetery in Wheatley Hill, which is also home to the Heritage Centre that celebrates the life of this great man who did so much for the village of Wheatley Hill during his time as Chairman of the Parish Council.

== Shipping piers ==

The first pier here was built in 1839 at what was then the edge of the harbour. It served as a terminal for steamships, which could be relatively easily filled with coal here. The pier ensured a sufficient security distance from the city, since these ships were fueled by coal which presented a fire risk. The current piers built in 1907 consist of floating pontoons, which are accessible from land by ten movable bridges.
The 688 metres (2,257 ft) long landing place originally served the passenger steamers of the overseas lines. Among others, the great Hapag-Lloyd liners landed here. Today only the HADAG ferries, harbour tour ships and motor launches, passenger ships serving the lower Elbe, and catamarans to Stade and Helgoland still travel to the piers. Ships travel from here daily to the musical island of the concert, ""The Lion King"".

The old piers were destroyed during the Second World War, so today's pontoons were rebuilt between 1953 and 1955. The last section destroyed in the War, between bridges 2 and 3, was not rebuilt until 1976. During the modernisation begun in 1999, the roofing and lighting were updated. Part of this modernisation is planned to include replacing bridge 7.


=== Cultural monument ===
The terminal building, built from volcanic tuff, and the piers were constructed between 1907 and 1909 in the same location as the old Landungsbrücken. It was designed as a representative shipping station by the architectural company of Raabe & Wöhlecke for the department  of river and harbour construction of the construction deputation. With its length of 205 m, its numerous gateways to the ships' piers, its domes and towers, it sets a structural accent. The architectural sculptures were created by Arthur Bock.
The complex was classified as a historical monument on 15 September 2003.


== Public transport interchange ==

A connection with the S-Bahn and U-Bahn is provided through Landungsbrücken station.


== Stammsiel ==
One of Hamburg's oldest and largest sewerage systems is near the Landungsbrücken. It is part of the ""Stadtwasserkunst"" designed by William Lindley in 1842. The Geest-Stammsiel collects sewage from far parts of the city before it is transported under the Elbe to the main purification plant Köhlbrandhöft on the opposite side of the Elbe, by means of a pumping station about 100 m upstream of the old Elbe tunnel. The sluice can be travelled by boat. For the rowing trips of Kaiser Willhelm II, a separate underground dock was constructed, viewable by appointment.

The compound has the formula P(C6H4SO3Na)3. This white solid is an unusual example of a water-soluble phosphine. Its complexes are also water-soluble.  Its complex with rhodium is used in the industrial production of butyraldehyde.


== Synthesis ==
TPPTS is synthesized by sulfonation of triphenylphosphine.  The sulfonation occurs at one meta-position of each of the three phenyl rings.  The sulfonation agent is oleum, a solution of sulfur trioxide in sulfuric acid. Immediately upon dissolving in the oleum, the phosphine is protonated.  It is the phosphonium salt that undergoes the sulfonation which explains its meta selectivity:

HP(C6H5)3+  +  3 SO3   →   [HP(C6H4SO3H)3]+As a Lewis base, tppts is stronger than triphenylphosphine.


== TPPTS at the origin of two-phase homogeneous catalysis ==
TPPTS was first synthesized in 1975 by E.G Kuntz who was an engineer at Rhône-Poulenc with the aim of carrying out a two-phase homogeneous catalysis in which the aqueous phase catalyst could be easily separated from the reaction products and recycled. Using TPPTS, allowed him to prepare water-soluble complexes with Rh(I), Ni(0), Pd(0).  E.G. Kuntz patented several two-phase homogeneous catalytic reactions:

hydroformylation of propylene with Rh(I) TPPTS, later leading to the Ruhrchemie / Rhône-Poulenc process.
hydrocyanation of olefins and dienes with Ni(0) TPPTS.
telomerization of butadiene to 2.7 octadiene -1-ol with Pd(0) TPPTS.
The Rh(I) TPPTS catalyst was later used by D.Morel to synthetize geranylacetone from myrcene and farnesylacetone from beta-farnesene which are intermediates in the synthesis of vitamin E.  This process was industrialized by Rhône-Poulenc in 1988.The industrial use of TPPTS and homogeneous biphasic catalysis has been reviewed.


== Uses in hydroformylation ==
Complexes of TPPTS are very soluble in water, which is the basis of its industrial application.  Tppts-based rhodium catalysts were introduced in 1984 for a two-phase hydroformylation of propene by the Ruhrchemie / Rhône-Poulenc process.  Hydroformylation, also known as oxo synthesis, is the reaction of an alkene with carbon monoxide and hydrogen.  Traditionally, hydroformylation is catalyzed by rhodium or cobalt complexes in nonaqueous solution  The industrial use of Tppts and homogeneous biphasic catalysis were mostly ignored in academic research until E.G. Kuntz published a review of its previous work in 1987. Then, from 1990, use of TPPTS was rapidly become popular with thousand of citations in 2004.

The Baroque Revival style-building from 1917 was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 2013. The bath house was shortly thereafter reopened by a group of volunteers.


== History ==
In 1898, the Social Democratic group in Copenhagen City Council, headed by later mayor Jens Jensen, proposed the construction of a series of municipal bath houses in the city's working-class neighbourhoods. They were seen as an important part of the drive to alleviate sanitary problems in the city. Many working-class families, living in overcrowded tenements, had no place to bathe. The first municipal bath house opened in Saxogade in 1903. It was followed by Sofiegade Public Baths in Christianshavn and a bath house in Helsingørsgade in the Borgergade-Adelgade neighbourhood. The public bath house in Sjællandsgade was constructed in 1916–1917. The section for women was located on the ground floor while the one for men was located on the first floor. The coal-fired boiler was also located in a room on the ground floor.The building was designed by city architect Hans Wright.The building was decommissioned when private bath rooms became common later in the century. The building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places on 20 December 2013.


== Architecture ==

Designed in the then-popular Baroque Revival style, Sjællandsgade Public Baths are constructed in red brick with symmetrically placed windows, a hipped red tile roof and lesenes at the corners. A tall, free-standing chimney was originally located next to the building but it has been demolished.


== Today ==
Sjællandsgade Public Baths was reopened as a public bath house by a group of volunteers in the mid-2010s. It is occasionally also used as a venue for exhibitions and other events.

The paper was founded in 1900 and stopped being published in 1992. In the 1950s-1980s the paper was known for its investigative reporting about the Sicilian Mafia.,"L'Ora (English: The Hour) was a Sicilian daily newspaper published in Palermo. The paper was founded in 1900 and stopped being published in 1992. In the 1950s-1980s the paper was known for its investigative reporting about the Sicilian Mafia.


== Foundation ==
The paper was founded on the initiative of the entrepreneurial Florio family from Palermo with interests in shipping, shipbuilding, trade and wine industry, fisheries, mining, metallurgy and ceramics. The first issue was published on April 22, 1900. The formal owner was Carlo Di Rudinì, the son of the former prime minister of Italy Antonio Di Rudinì, but the main shareholder and financier was Ignazio Florio Jr. The first editor of the paper until 1902 was Vincenzo Morello, one of the most respected Italian political journalists of the time. Before directing L'Ora, Morello had worked for La Tribuna, at that time the most widespread newspaper in the center-south of Italy. Other collaborators were Napoleone Colajanni, Francesco Saverio Nitti and Luigi Capuana.
The political direction of the newspaper was generally republican and progressive, representing the Sicilian entrepreneurial middle class. After the First World War the editorial line turned against the rise of fascism. During this period one of the significant contributors was Alberto Cianca. In November 1926, in the aftermath of the failed attack against Benito Mussolini in Bologna, the paper was suppressed, along with other anti-Fascist newspapers.L'Ora reappeared in January 1927 under the direction of Nicola Pascazio, a man close to the Fascist regime, former editor of the Il Popolo d'Italia (""People of Italy""), the organ of the National Fascist Party, with the subtitle ""fascist newspaper of the Mediterranean"". The Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943 resulted in the suspension of the newspaper, but publishing resumed on April 8, 1946.The paper changed ownership several times. In 1954, the widow of the last owner sold the newspaper to the GATE company, which was owned by the Italian Communist Party (Partito Comunista Italiano – PCI) and directed by Amerigo Terenzi, already in charge of the newspaper Paese Sera.


== Golden years ==

Under the new ownership, the newspaper enjoyed its golden years under the editor-in-chief Vittorio Nistico, who directed the paper between 1954-1975. In this period the journal developed into a newspaper that published many investigative reports about the Sicilian Mafia, in an era that the organisation was hardly mentioned.In 1958, L'Ora published a series of investigative reports about the rise of Mafia boss Luciano Leggio in Corleone after the killing of the previous boss Michele Navarra in August 1958, by reporters Felice Chilanti, Mario Farinella, Enzo Lucchi, Michele Pantaleone, Castrense Dadò and Enzo Perrone. The retaliation of Leggio was swift: at 4:52 a.m. on October 19, 1958, a bomb of five kilos TNT exploded in front the newspaper office blowing up half the printing press. Two days later the paper appeared again; the front-page headline read: ""The mafia threatens us, the investigation continues"" (see Infobox).The price of the journal's civic engagement was the killing of three of its journalists. The first was Cosimo Cristina, who was killed on May 5, 1960, investigating the Mafia in the area of Termini Imerese. Next was Mauro De Mauro who disappeared on September 16, 1970, investigating the involvement of the Mafia with the death of Eni president Enrico Mattei. And finally, Giovanni Spampinato, who was killed on October 27, 1972, while looking into the activities of neo-fascism in Sicily and Mafia smuggling activities along the east coast of Sicily.


== Decline ==
In the 1970s, the newspaper started to have financial problems. As an afternoon paper, it was more vulnerable to the competition of TV news than its main competitor, the Giornale di Sicilia. The paper also lost support of the PCI that decided to concentrate on its main publication L'Unità in combination with the historic compromise, trying to accommodate the Christian Democrats (DC).Although L'Ora changed to publish as a morning newspaper in 1976, the costs that this entailed proved to be excessive and in 1979 the PCI decided the closure of the newspaper. L'Ora, however, ""refused to die"": a cooperative of journalists and administrators got the right to use the title and the property, while a cooperative of workers got the use of the equipment under the same conditions. The measures were taken in the hope of acquiring financial and editorial independence. Nevertheless, by 1980 the Giornale di Sicilia managed to take advantage of the papers weakened position and demoralized staff to lure away four of its younger and promising reporters (Roberto Ciuno, Francesco La Licata, Daniele Billiteri and Franco Nicastro) to form a new crime staff, which competed with L'Ora on one of its main news subjects.From the economic point of view the journal was kept alive thanks to the NEM (Nuova Editrice Meridionale), a company formed by the cooperatives in agreement with the Communist Party, which owned the title and the equipment. Despite the fact that the technological upgrading and renovation of the headquarters in Palermo was successful, editorial and managerial problems led to a lack of adequate leadership. Although the paper enjoyed a revival of sales in 1992, this did not prevent the PDS (Partito Democratico della Sinistra - Democratic Party of the Left), the successor of the PCI, to liquidate L'Ora. The last issue was published on May 8, 1992.On 29 September 2019, the street where the editorial staff of the newspaper used to be located was renamed Via ""Giornale L'Ora""  on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the death of Vittorio Nisticò, the historical director of the newspaper. A commemorative plaque was inaugurated to honour the three reporters killed by the Mafia: Mauro De Mauro, Cosimo Cristina and Giovanni Spampinato and the Mafia attack that hit the printing house in 1958.

She is also known for her roles in Two Faces of My Girlfriend, Castaway on the Moon, and History of a Salaryman.


== Early life ==
The second of three children, Jung Ryeo-won was born in 1981, and emigrated to Brisbane, Australia in 1992 with her family. She encountered discrimination in grade school, which made her determined to become fluent in English. By junior high school, she had adapted to the Australian way of life. After attending MacGregor State High School, she graduated from Griffith University with a major in international business.


== Career ==


=== 2000–2006: Chakra ===
While she was an exchange student at Korea University from Griffith University in the 2000s, Jung was discovered on the streets of Apgujeong by Lee Sang-min, thereby changing her life and career path. She was placed in the K-pop girl group Chakra, along with Eeni, Eun and Hwangbo; their first album was released in 2000. Jung's morale was at a low in 2002, saying she sometimes felt alienated from her fellow Koreans, and was uncomfortable with the sexy clothes she was made to wear as a singer.


=== 2006–2012: Transitioning in acting ===
Chakra disbanded in 2004, and Jung pursued acting full-time. After undergoing 11 unsuccessful auditions that year, she said she began doubting her decision to become an actress. In 2005, she gained recognition in the cult vampire sitcom Hello Franceska, then made her breakthrough in the romantic comedy My Name Is Kim Sam-soon. The series was a massive success with average ratings of over 37%, and 50.5% for the finale. Jung was praised for her portrayal of a fragile but good-natured character who fights for the hero's love, and eventually became one of the few successful singer-turned-actresses in the country.Her follow-up series Autumn Shower received low ratings, but she rebounded with Which Star Are You From?, in which she played a country bumpkin living in the mountains of Gangwon Province. She was cast in her first movie leading role as a girl with multiple personality disorder in 2007's Two Faces of My Girlfriend, and though it was not a box office hit, she won Best New Actress at the Blue Dragon Film Awards.As the titular character in 2009's Princess Jamyung, Jung starred in her first period drama. She then played a hikikomori in Castaway on the Moon, arguably her most notable film yet.Both her 2011 big screen projects had elements of romance. She played a teacher in a small South Korean village who meets a North Korean officer in the war comedy/drama In Love and War, and in Kwak Kyung-taek's melodrama Pained, she played a hemophiliac who falls for her opposite, a man with analgesia, the inability to sense physical pain.Jung began 2012 by starring as the heroine in quirky series History of a Salaryman. Playing one of the most unusual female characters in Korean drama history, she delivered a fun, no-holds-barred performance as a red-haired, constantly swearing, selfish, reckless rich snob, but injected heart and raw emotion into a character that could've otherwise been very unlikable. Critics and audiences were impressed with her performance, and her series nabbed the top spot on the Monday and Tuesday primetime ratings lineup while she later won a Top Excellence Award at the SBS Drama Awards.She then starred in Never Ending Story, a romantic comedy about two people diagnosed with terminal illness who decide to spend their remaining time together preparing for death. In June 2012, Jung's contract with Won Entertainment expired and she signed with Bae Yong-joon's agency, KeyEast. Later that year, she played an idealistic screenwriter in The King of Dramas.


=== 2013–2017: Acting setback ===
In January 2013, Jung unveiled her official website, through which she hopes to connect with her fans. Messages from the actress are uploaded in the ""From rw"" section. She then reunited with Pained costar Kwon Sang-woo in the medical drama Medical Top Team, playing a charismatic and ambitious thoracic surgeon.Jung next played an impatient and careless radio producer in the cable series Bubble Gum in 2015; she and co-star Lee Dong-wook previously appeared together in the 2003 sitcom Do the Right Thing. In 2017, she starred in the legal procedural drama, Witch at Court, playing a highly ambitious prosecutor who speaks her mind and is known for her aggressive investigation tactics. For her portrayal, she received the Top Excellence Award at the 2017 KBS Drama Awards.


=== 2018–present: Return in television and continued work ===
In 2018, Jung starred in the black comedy film Gate. She then starred in the SBS' gastronomy drama Wok of Love.In 2019, Jung starred in the legal television series Prosecutor Civil War.In September 2020, after Jung's contract with KeyEast expired, she signed with H & Entertainment.


== Other activities ==
Jung published Ryeo-won's Sketchbook in 2007, which contained her drawings and writings about her Christian faith. Though she hasn't received formal instruction in fine arts, Jung likes to express herself through drawing in her spare time. Two of her artwork pieces were sold at a charity auction in 2012.In March 2014, Jung began hosting Art Star Korea on cable channel StoryOn, an audition program/reality show featuring contemporary artists.

== Grande école degrees ==
KEDGE Business School is a grande école, a French institution of higher education that is separate from, but parallel and often connected to, the main framework of the French public university system. Grandes écoles are elite academic institutions that admit students through an extremely competitive process, and a significant proportion of their graduates occupy the highest levels of French society. Similar to Ivy League schools in the United States, Oxbridge in the UK, and C9 League in China, graduation from a grande école is considered the prerequisite credential for any top government, administrative and corporate position in France.The degrees are accredited by the Conférence des Grandes Écoles and awarded by the Ministry of National Education (France). Higher education business degrees in France are organized into three levels thus facilitating international mobility: the Licence / Bachelor's degrees, and the Master's and Doctorat degrees. The Bachelors and the Masters are organized in semesters: 6 for the Bachelors and 4 for the Masters. Those levels of study include various ""parcours"" or paths based on UE (Unités d'enseignement or Modules), each worth a defined number of European credits (ECTS). A student accumulates those credits, which are generally transferable between paths. A Bachelors is awarded once 180 ECTS have been obtained (bac + 3); a Masters is awarded once 120 additional credits have been obtained (bac +5). The highly coveted PGE (Grand Ecole Program) ends with the degree of Master's in Management (MiM)

There was one intermediate station, Woodhall Spa.
The line opened in 1855 and was worked by the GNR, but the H&KJR company remained as an independent entity until 1923. The short line suffered from road competition after that time, and the passenger service was withdrawn in 1954, although a goods service was retained until 1971.

The short line suffered from road competition after that time, and the passenger service was withdrawn in 1954, although a goods service was retained until 1971. There is now no railway activity on the former line.


== Origins ==

In the first decades of the nineteenth century Horncastle had become an important centre for the buying and selling of horses, and it was a centre for agriculture in the district; its population in 1851 was 25,089.At the same time Woodhall Spa had developed as a location where people went to take the cure; the spring waters, containing iodine and bromine, had been found by Thomas Hotchkiss to have curative properties, especially for gout.Local people saw that a railway connection was a means to developing Horncastle; between 1845 and 1847 there were six unsuccessful attempts to promote a railway connection to the town. The Great Northern Railway operated the nearby main line at Kirkstead, opened in 1848. In 1851 the GNR built a canal wharf at Dogdyke, enabling to serve Horncastle using the canal as a branch.On 27 September 1853 a meeting was held at the Bull Inn, Horncastle, ""for the purpose of taking into consideration the propriety of establishing a line of railway between Horncastle and Kirkstead station on the Great Northern loop line."" The meeting resolved that ""the formation of a branch railway from the Kirkstead station to Horncastle would greatly promote the commercial and agricultural interests of the town and neighbourhood."" A sub-committee was appointed ""to confer with the Great Northern Company as to working of the proposed branch railway that company."" This resulted in the GNR agreeing to work the line for 50% of receipts.The Stamford Mercury reported that ""the meeting passed off vary amicably, with the slight exception of some very irrelevant observations made by Mr. Brailsford, of Toft Grange, respecting compensation to the Navigation Company. The Horncastle Canal evidently saw the promotion of a railway as inimical to its interests, and the canal company pressed its opposition in the Parliamentary hearings for the line. In addition, opinion formers in Horncastle were concerned that local people would purchase goods in Boston or Lincoln by travelling there by train, rather than supporting local businesses.Nevertheless the Horncastle and Kirkstead Junction Railway was authorised by Parliament on 10 July 1854; share capital was £48,000, with borrowing powers of £13,000. The local company built the line, using the contractor Thomas Brassey; Brassey had taken £15,000 in shares on the understanding that he would be appointed as the contractor. The 1854 - 1855 winter was exceptionally severe, and work did not start until March 1855.An intermediate station was to have been made at Roughton but this was not proceeded with and the only intermediate station was Woodhall Spa.The line was inspected for Board of Trade approval for opening by Lt-Colonel Wynne on 6 August 1855. However he reported that ""I found the permanent way, generally, in a very incomplete state, and the rails especially so much out of adjustment, that I am of the opinion that the Horncastle Railway cannot be opened without danger to the public using the same"".The Lincolnshire Chronicle reported that ""Arrangements were made for running special trains ... during the day. This part of the proceedings was... obliged to be abandoned, in consequence of the government inspector (Col. Wynne), who passed over the line on Monday last, having declined to certify the line as fit for passenger-traffic. The late heavy rains having caused the soil to settle unequally in various parts of the line, is reported to be the cause of the withholding of the certificate; but, as this is mere temporary derangement, which a few days' labour will suffice to remedy, the opening of the line for regular traffic will not be long deferred.""The line could not therefore be opened for passenger purposes, and it was opened for ""light goods"" only on 11 August 1855. An opening ceremony for the line had been arranged for that day, and it went ahead anyway, despite the refusal for passenger operation. Rectification work must have been accomplished swiftly, for on 11 August 1855 Lt-Colonel Yolland inspected the line and found it satisfactory.


== Opening ==
The line opened fully on 26 September 1855. The directors had negotiated with the Great Northern Railway to work their line; the GNR operated the adjacent main line, between Lincoln and Boston. The new branch was 7+1⁄2 miles in length from a junction at Kirkstead, on the main line. The junction at Kirkstead faced away from Kirkstead station, towards Boston, so branch trains had to reverse direction at the junction. Stations on the branch were Woodhall Spa and Horncastle.The reference to light goods probably refers to packages that could be manhandled on the passenger platform, prior to commissioning of the goods shed and cranage facilities; the line opened fully for the latter traffic on 26 September 1855.The total earnings for the part year from 8 August to the end of 1855, were £1,537. Part that sum was payable to the Great Northern Railway for working the line and for use of Kirkstead GNR station; £952 was the Horncastle and Kirkstead Railway's portion. A dividend of 3s ld. per share, stated to be ""equivalent to 4% per annum upon the share capital of the company (less income-tax), leaving a balance of 331. 16s. 7d. for the next account.""


== Woodhall Spa ==
The line was originally operated under the ""one engine in steam"" system, but from 3 June 1889 a block post was instituted at Woodhall Spa together with a crossing loop, and block working was operated.

For some years Woodhall Spa had no goods facility; a siding for the purpose was provided from 4 April 1887.In 1887 the passenger train service consisted of eight trains each way daily; the journey time was 28 minutes; there were additional trains on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday and from 1898 one train conveyed a through coach from London. There was a Sunday service at first, but this was discontinued in June 1868. In 1910 the basic train service was six journeys each way with additional market-day services, but by 1938 it had risen again to eight with an additional service on Saturdays.
The Autumn Horncastle horse fairs were renowned for the quality of the animals being sold, and the railway provided the means for local horses to be brought in, and despatched to their new owners at destinations countrywide. The late 1800s were the peak years and up to 150 horses arrived at the station every day for several days before. However the trade declined after 1918 as the use of mechanical transport increased. Nevertheless, Horncastle never developed industrially.


== Finances 1890 ==
In 1890 the Board of Trade pressed the proprietors of the railway to improve it in certain respects. The directors considered that this might be the opportune time to sell the line to the  Great Northern Railway. They offered to do so on the basis of £10 H&KJR shares being exchanged for £18 face value of GNR shares. The GNR considered this too high a price, but assisted the H&KJR in obtaining a loan for the necessary work.


== After 1900 ==
Kirkstead was renamed Woodhall Junction on 10 July 1922.After World War I the branch passenger trains were operated by a two coach set that had been converted from GNR steam railmotors nos 5 and 6. These vehicles were used until the end of passenger services on the line. (They were subsequently retained in service elsewhere, until 1959.)
The Horncastle Railway Company continued in existence until the grouping of the railways in 1923, following the Railways Act 1922; the company had never operated its own trains and was simply a financial entity. Ownership of the line passed to the London and North Eastern Railway. It had ""rarely"" paid less than 6% in dividend.Due to the outbreak of hostilities, the line was closed to passenger operation on 11 September 1939, but the service was reinstated from 4 December 1939.In 1948 nationalisation of the railways took place, and British Railways took control.
For some years the passenger carryings on the line were declining, and the passenger service was discontinued from 13 September 1954, following the increase of road bus competition. One goods train ran daily on the line until closure on 5 April 1971, although Woodhall Spa's goods siding had closed on 27 April 1964. For six months prior to final closure, after the passenger services on the line from Lincoln to Coningsby stopped, Horncastle goods trains were the only users of the former Loop Line between Bardney and Woodhall Junction.The solum of the line from Horncastle to Woodhall Spa was later acquired by Lincolnshire County Council and is now part of the Viking Way and Spa Trail long-distance footpaths.

Titus Vinius,"['12 births', '1st-century Romans', '69 deaths', 'All articles needing additional references', 'Ancient Roman generals', 'Articles needing additional references from November 2014', 'Articles with short description', 'Assassinated Roman politicians', 'Imperial Roman consuls', 'People of the Year of the Four Emperors', 'Roman consuls who died in office', 'Roman governors of Gallia Narbonensis', 'Short description is different from Wikidata']",Titus Vinius (12 – 69) was a Roman general and one of the most powerful men in Rome during the reign of the Emperor Galba.,"Titus Vinius (12 – 69) was a Roman general and one of the most powerful men in Rome during the reign of the Emperor Galba.


== Stories ==
Plutarch has a number of stories of Vinius' early life, all to his discredit. He says that when, as a young man, he was serving in his first campaign, he brought his commander's wife into the camp by night disguised as a soldier, and had sex with her in the general's quarters. He was imprisoned for this by Caligula, but on that emperor's death was released.
Later on, again according to Plutarch and Tacitus, when he was invited to supper by the emperor Claudius he stole a gold drinking cup. Claudius was told of this, and invited him to supper again the following evening. When Vinius came, Claudius made his point by having his attendants set earthenware plates before him instead of silver. Nevertheless, Tacitus, who elsewhere describes him as ""the most worthless of mankind"", says that as proconsul of Gallia Narbonensis he administered the province with strict integrity.


== As consul ==
Vinius was commander of one of the legions in Hispania when Galba was governor there. When Galba was proclaimed emperor in 68, Vinius accompanied him to Rome, where Galba chose him to be his colleague as consul. Vinius quickly came to have great influence—indeed, it was said that he and two others, Cornelius Laco, the commander of the Praetorian Guard, and Galba's freedman Icelus Martianus, virtually controlled the emperor. The three were called ""the three pedagogues"" because of their influence on Galba. According to Suetonius and Plutarch, Vinius was exceedingly greedy for money, prepared to do anything in return for a bribe. In particular, he protected Tigellinus, who was blamed for having corrupted Nero, from retribution in exchange for a large bribe.


== Support for Otho, and death ==
In early 69 Galba was faced with the need to designate an heir. Titus Vinius supported Otho, having already secretly agreed that Otho should marry his daughter. Galba, however, for once refused to follow Vinius' advice and instead selected Piso Licinianus as his adopted son and designated heir. Otho responded by persuading the Praetorian guard to proclaim him emperor instead of Galba. With turmoil in the streets, Titus Vinius advised Galba to remain in the palace and to arm the slaves in the palace to help defend it. Laco and Icelus, however, advised Galba to go out and show himself. Galba followed their advice, and was killed by the Praetorians. Vinius tried to run away, calling out that Otho had not ordered him killed, but was run through with a spear.

== Early life ==
Fearnley-Whittingstall was born in Hampstead, London, to Robert Fearnley-Whittingstall, of a landed gentry family formerly of Watford and Hawkswick, Hertfordshire, and gardener and writer Jane Margaret, daughter of Colonel John Hawdon Lascelles, of the King's Royal Rifle Corps, OBE. He was brought up in Gloucestershire. He was educated at Summer Fields School, Eton College, and St Peter's College, Oxford, where he read philosophy and psychology.


== Early career ==
After a temporary relocation to Africa, where Fearnley-Whittingstall was considering a career in wildlife conservation, he returned to England and became a sous chef at the River Café in London. He has since said that ""being messy"" and ""lacking discipline"", though, made him unsuitable for working in the River Café kitchen, but that he regards his time there as a period that helped shape his current career.Following his time at the River Café, Fearnley-Whittingstall commenced freelance journalism and was published in Punch, the Evening Standard, and The Sunday Times.


== Television ==


=== Early shows ===
Fearnley-Whittingstall's initial television exposure was on A Cook on the Wild Side (1995), an exploration of earthy cuisine. His next series was TV Dinners (1996), in one episode of which he notoriously flambéed and puréed a human placenta to then serve as pâté. In 2002, he presented the six-episode series, Treats from the Edwardian Country House.


=== River Cottage ===
In 1997, Fearnley-Whittingstall moved into River Cottage, a former game-keeper's lodge in the grounds of Slape Manor in Netherbury, Dorset, UK, which he had previously used as a weekend and holiday home. The lodge became the setting for three Channel 4 series: Escape to River Cottage, Return to River Cottage, and River Cottage Forever, all directed by Garry John Hughes. He has become an ardent supporter of the organic movement.  In 2004, Beyond River Cottage followed Fearnley-Whittingstall's progress as he set up a new business, River Cottage H.Q., on a 44-acre (18 ha) property close to Dottery (near Bridport), Dorset, with his family. Underpinning his new enterprise is the selling of the produce cultivated on his property at the local marketplace, and audiences bear witness to the host's experiences as a produce seller, while also intermittently receiving the recipe lessons traditionally seen on food shows. The series concludes with a Christmas special in which a feast is brought together, consisting of a 10-bird roast using Fearnley-Whittingstall's own geese and ducks.In 2005, a series called The View from River Cottage was produced using extracts from the four previous series, accompanied by newly recorded narration. This was followed by River Cottage Road Trip special that consisted of two newly produced one-hour instalments. During 2006, Fearnley-Whittingstall moved River Cottage HQ from the original barn near Bridport to its new premises, Park Farm, a 66-acre (27 ha) farm near Uplyme on the West Dorset/East Devon border. A new series called The River Cottage Treatment was filmed there and was broadcast on Channel 4 in November 2006. This premise of this series involved guests described as ""urban-dwellers, fast-food lovers, and convenient food-mongers"" to spend a week with the host on the new property, the guests being required to undertake farm duties and to eat according to the River Cottage philosophy.In 2007, Fearnley-Whittingstall presented, River Cottage: Gone Fishing, a short series that is the concept's 10th overall, in which he examines some of the lesser-known fish to be caught around the British Isles. From 2008, he filmed magazine-style food programmes, produced at River Cottage HQ, based on the seasonal themes. River Cottage Spring ran from 28 May 2008 to 25 June 2008 on Channel 4, and in one of the episodes, Fearnley-Whittingstall demonstrated his ""holistic"" approach to cooking by teaching a vegetarian how to slaughter, prepare, and cook lamb.In late 2008, River Cottage Autumn was broadcast from 16 October to 6 November 2008. In one of the autumnal episodes, Fearnley-Whittingstall, together with his friend, John, embarks on a mission to catch crustaceans at a nearby beach with the use of pots. The pair seek to catch prawns, crabs and lobsters, in addition to the blue velvet swimming crab that is commonly found at the particular coastal location where they are based.  On 19 October 2009, a new series of four episodes aired on Channel 4: River Cottage – Winter's on the Way. In one of the episodes from the winter series, Fearnley-Whittingstall captures, prepares, and cooks rabbits that he finds on his property and introduces viewers to salsify; according to the host, salsify was popular during the Victorian era.


=== New River Cottage ===
In September 2010, a new series of River Cottage episodes, entitled River Cottage Every Day, commenced. The series encouraged viewers to cook from scratch more frequently and was accompanied by a book of the same name.
In autumn 2011, a new series, River Cottage Veg, was launched and is based on Fearnley-Whittingstall's developed awareness regarding the problematic way in which meat is produced and consumed in the modern era. During the series, the food activist addresses the challenge that he defines in the series' first episode: ""A whole summer without flesh"". Fearnley-Whittingstall explains further: ""In the weeks ahead, I'll be expanding my vegetable horizons, seeking out new flavours and textures, and cooking up a whole raft of vegetable dishes with the same excitement and gusto that I've always bestowed on meat and fish."" A new series of River Cottage, entitled Hugh's Three Good Things, aired on Channel 4 in December 2012. Accompanied by a cookbook, the series was based on the notion that a great meal can be prepared from gathering three good ingredients; in the first episode, Fearnley-Whittingstall uses beetroot, egg, and anchovies to make an open sandwich. He also competed against guest chefs in each episode and viewers were invited to challenge the television host with a superior recipe. In 2012, he presented River Cottage: Three Go Mad a three-episode series inviting various British TV personalities to River Cottage and teaching them how to cook.


=== New series ===
In August 2015, alongside Lindsey Chapman, he hosted a series of five daily programmes on BBC One, linked to three evening programmes Big Blue Live. The series concentrated on marine wildlife around the UK coast. 
In November 2015, Fearnley-Whittingstall presented Hugh's War on Waste on BBC One, campaigning against waste by food producers, retailers, and consumers.In 2018, he filmed Britain's Fat Fight with Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, a documentary for BBC One, where he explored the obesity crisis in Britain, asking food producers, restaurants, and the government to confront the crisis. Fearnley-Whittingstall's letter to the government was signed by 97,869 people; the government responded, and on 25 June, launched a new childhood obesity strategy. Also in the programme, Fearnley-Whittingstall, in partnership with Newcastle City Council, launched Newcastle Can (newcastlecan.com), an initiative and experiment aimed to encourage the citizens of Newcastle to work together to get healthier and fitter.


=== Guest appearances ===
Hugh Fearnly-Whittingstall appeared on Celebrity Countdown in 1998; he was named by former host Richard Whiteley as the de facto champion with the highest score of the series. In 1997, he appeared on Channel 4's Time Team live dig in Turkdean. A year later, he again joined the Time Team live dig, this time at Bawsey.
He then appeared on the first series of Channel 4's The F Word in 2005, advising Gordon Ramsay on the rearing of turkeys at Ramsay's London home; the turkeys are eaten in the last episode of the series. Further appearances on The F-Word in 2006 and 2007 involved Fearnley-Whittingstall advising Ramsay on the rearing of pigs and lambs; again, the consumption of the livestock occurs in the last episodes of the series.
At the start of 2008, Fearnley-Whittingstall – along with fellow celebrity chefs Jamie Oliver and Ramsay – was featured in Channel 4's Big Food Fight season; his contribution to the season was Hugh's Chicken Run, which was shown over three consecutive nights. He created three chicken farms in Axminster (one intensive, one commercial free-range, and the third a community farm project staffed by volunteers), culminating in a ""Chicken Out!"" campaign to encourage the eating of free-range chicken. In 2008, based on the success of the project, further discussion occurred among Channel 4 executives regarding the filming of another season.In 2009, Fearnley-Whittingstall became a permanent team captain, opposing a different guest captain each week, on a food-based panel game, The Big Food Fight, which began on Channel 4 on 8 September; this is not to be confused with the earlier project of the same name. On 12 June, he was a guest on BBC One's Have I Got News For You and he recorded a guest spot on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs that was broadcast on 26 July and again on 31 July 2009.In 2010, Fearnley-Whittingstall made an appearance on the BBC One comedy panel show, Would I Lie to You?, with host Rob Brydon, who awarded him the ""Liar of the Week"" prize.
Fearnley-Whittingstall also appeared on BBC Two's satirical music panel show, Never Mind the Buzzcocks, on an episode recorded in 2008; airing was delayed until 19 January 2011, due to the scandals surrounding Russell Brand that led to his resignation from the BBC.


== Writing ==
Fearnley-Whittingstall published Cuisine Bon Marché in 1994. He wrote the cookbooks, The River Cottage Year, The River Cottage Fish Book (with Nick Fisher), The River Cottage Cookbook (winner of the Andre Simon Food Book of the Year award, the Guild of Food Writers’ Michael Smith Award, and the Glenfiddich Trophy and Food Book of the Year), and The River Cottage Meat Book (the last two books with photographs by Simon Wheeler). His most recent book, published on 29 March 2011, is River Cottage Every Day.He has written articles for The Guardian and The Observer since 2001. A collection of his short articles was published in October 2006 under the title Hugh Fearlessly Eats It All: Dispatches from the Gastronomic Frontline. He edited The Big Bento Box of Unuseless Japanese Inventions, written by Kenji Kawakami.


== Activism ==
In January 2008, Fearnley-Whittingstall called on hospitality and food-service operators to use less intensively farmed chicken:

It's one thing to challenge individual consumers to give up intensively reared chicken, but it's also an issue where anyone in the business of selling chicken has to take a stand... in some cases I know chefs, not naming names, at the very high-end sector who are not using free-range birds. Some of them are on the road to Michelin stars.
In 2012, Fearnley-Whittingstall filmed a Channel 4 series, Hugh's Fish Fight. The series was broadcast in three parts on Channel 4. The campaign's website said it had received over 700,000 signatures by 2012.In November 2015, he filmed Hugh's War on Waste. with the BBC and began a campaign to reduce consumer waste in the UK. The two programmes focused on food and clothing waste, both by supermarkets and by shoppers in their own homes.
In 2018, he filmed Britain's Fat Fight with Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, where he explored the obesity crisis in Britain, asking food producers, restaurants and the government to confront the crisis.In 2021 Hugh joined the Green Party.

He painted still lifes, history paintings and landscapes. A scion of the famous Brueghel family of painters, he trained in Antwerp with his father and later worked for some time in Paris.


== Life ==
Brueghel was born in Antwerp where he was baptised on 24 December 1635.  He was the second son of Jan Brueghel the Younger and Anna-Maria Janssens. His mother was the daughter of the Antwerp history painter Abraham Janssens. His father was the son of Jan Brueghel the Elder, who was one of the most important creative forces in early 17th century Antwerp, a prolific painter in many genres and a frequent collaborator of Rubens. His father had taken over the large workshop of Jan the Elder on his death in 1625 and continued its large output of biblical, mythological, allegorical, genre and still life paintings. Philips' brothers Jan Pieter, Abraham Brueghel, Ferdinand and Jan Baptist Brueghel also became successful artists.

He trained in the family workshop and joined in the guild year 1654-1655 the Antwerp Guild of St. Luke as a 'wijnmeester', i.e. the son of a master.  He continued to work in the family workshop and was sent to work in Paris in the period from 1658 to 1661. Here he lived with his uncle Jan Valdor, the husband of his mother's sister Catherine Janssens. Philips' father had signed a contract for him to work for three years for Valdor for a period of three years.  He returned to Antwerp and is mentioned the last time in Antwerp in 1662.Philips must have died before 1678 as he is not mentioned as an heir when his father died that year.


== Work ==
Very few works of Brueghel are known.  He is believed to be the painter of the Fall of Phaethon signed 'P Breughel' (Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe). A still life of Pike, Barbel and other Fish in a Bowl, Celery, Radishes, Pumpkins, Melons and a Basket of Fruit by a Stone Wall (McMaster Museum of Art) signed 'PHILVPS BREVGHEL' shows a more original approach than that of his painting brothers, who had mainly remained flower painters. This work is reminiscent of the work of Peter van Boucle and other Flemish painters active in Paris.

High adventure programs of the Order of the Arrow,"['All articles lacking reliable references', 'Articles lacking reliable references from March 2009', 'Order of the Arrow', 'Scouting events', 'Use mdy dates from April 2012']","The Order of the Arrow in the Boy Scouts of America, in its focus on service, contains four different high adventure programs at the national level that focus on conservation. These programs occur at the four national  high adventure bases that the Boy Scouts own. They are only open to youth aged 14 to 20, with specific ages varying by program, and are available at a substantially lower price than other programs at the base. They each include a period of service and a trek period during which the participants get to plan their own routes and experience the best of the bases.","The Order of the Arrow in the Boy Scouts of America, in its focus on service, contains four different high adventure programs at the national level that focus on conservation.

They each include a period of service and a trek period during which the participants get to plan their own routes and experience the best of the bases.


== Trail Crew ==

The first program that the Order of the Arrow established is the Trail Crew trek at Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico.  The program, started in 1995, is held in multiple sessions every summer.  Each session is a fourteen-day program for Order of the Arrow members aged 16 to 20 that gives participants an opportunity to work on various conservation projects around the ranch. Participants build trail for seven days and then go on a seven-day trek throughout Philmont. Many Order of the Arrow lodges and sections offer scholarships to Order of the Arrow members.


== Wilderness Voyage ==

After the success of the Trail Crew program, the Order of the Arrow established another program following the same model at the Northern Tier National High Adventure Bases in Minnesota. Instead of hiking and backpacking as in Trail Crew, the participants use canoes for transportation. Their work occurs in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in the Superior National Forest. Since its inception, the program has worked on some of the most treacherous portage trails in the area including the notorious Birch to Frog and Ensign to Boot portages. In the summer of 2007, the program did its first work in Canada on the Big Knife portage on the Canada–US border.
Participants aged 16–20 are led by Foremen of the Northern Tier Conservation Department. Participants do conservation service for seven days and then go on a seven-day canoe trip. Crews have traveled all the way to International Falls and the Grand Portage National Monument on Lake Superior in only a week. The program also draws much from the history of the area, as many of the trails were previously maintained by the Civilian Conservation Corps and crews often map their treks around historic routes often including the Height of Land Portage.In 2003, the program and the Order of the Arrow received the US Forest Service Chief's Volunteer Award for Youth Volunteer Service.


== Canadian Odyssey ==
The Canadian Odyssey Order of the Arrow High Adventure Program began in the summer of 2009. Based at the Northern Tier National High Adventure Bases, this program builds on the success of the Wilderness Voyage program by doing trail work in the Quetico Provincial Park in Ontario. Work crews, composed of Arrowmen aged 16–20, canoe from the base in Atikokan, Ontario to base Ely, Minnesota. As of 2013, the program began working exclusively in the Southern Quetico.


== Ocean Adventure ==
Starting in the summer of 2005, another program was established at the Florida National High Adventure Sea Base in the Florida Keys. This program also has a week of service but, initially, it followed a week during which participants gain PADI SCUBA Certification. The OAOA participants, aged 16–20, provided services such as marine life monitoring for the Reef Environmental Education Foundation, and coral reef conservation for the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. OAOA underwent a program revision in 2010, thus cancelling all OAOA programs for that year, and resumed under the new program in 2011.  Under the new program, participants spend a week providing service to the various parts of the Florida Keys, including a few spaces on the Florida Sea base property, such as Big Munson Island or the Florida Keys Heritage Trail.  The remainder of the time is spent on the water, enjoying the Sea Base program.In 2017, the Ocean Adventure program began a new chapter of its short history. This new program, based out of Camp Jackson Sawyer, sent participants to Ft. Jefferson at Dry Tortugas National Park. There, scouts work hand-in-hand with NPS maintenance staff to ensure that the Civil War era fort continues to be accessible to its visitors. Fishing, kayaking, and snorkeling in one of the least traveled national parks is what any scout can expect to experience while there.


== Summit Experience ==
With the opening of the Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve for high adventure programming in 2014, the Order of the Arrow developed a program to be held at the Summit Bechtel Reserve.  This program differs from its counterparts in that admission to the program is granted only to those Arrowmen who are between the ages of fourteen and eighteen during the entire trek.  Further, the program is significantly shorter; the program runs for only eight days, as opposed to the fourteen of the other programs.  However, the structure of the program echoes the structure of the Northern Tier and Philmont programs.  For the first four days, participants work on a project in the New River Gorge area; the remaining time on the trek focuses on the various activities that are offered at the Summit Bechtel Reserve, especially around whitewater rafting and kayaking.

The game was created by UK-based Data Design Interactive.  It is one of three parts of their Myth Makers franchise of video games.


== Gameplay ==
Players control Trixie, the main character in the game. In order to proceed to the next level, players must collect eight power rods to activate a teleporter while being attacked by various enemies. When the player completes a level and plays it again, a menu appears with a second mode available, ‘Score Pickups’. If the level is completed again in this mode, the player will unlock ‘Time Attack’ mode. Completion of this mode unlocks the ‘Hidden Pickups!’ alternative mode.


== Plot ==
The story follows Trixie, the Easter Bunny cadet who chases down Penumbra (a tyrant) who has stolen the Myth Makers Orbs and taken over the Toyland. Trixie has to retrieve the stolen Orbs, defeat the evil Penumbra and save Toyland.


== Reception ==
The game was universally panned by reviewers. IGN gave it a 1.4/10 stating sarcastically that it's ""really just a fantastic title like Ninjabread Man and Anubis II; everyone should experience Trixie in Toyland just as everyone should experience throat cancer"".

== Context ==
Stanley is part of an international move that challenges the (white, male, straight) Jolly Jack Tar stereotype in maritime historiography. The discipline is now taking an interdisciplinary turn towards cultural studies and mobilities.
New maritime history recognises that seafarers are workers who get wet. They are globalised travellers in their own right who can enjoy a mobility of identity that corresponds with their spatial mobility. They may well be black, Asian, queer and/or female. They, and the heterotopic spaces, on which they sail connect with land, not least through intimate relationships and maritime commerce. Therefore, this New Maritime History connects to Port Studies, the new discipline which in Britain is most active at Liverpool University's Centre for Port and Maritime History and Portsmouth University's hub: Port Towns and Urban Cultures.
The radical tendency in maritime history is popularly associated with controversial historian Marcus Rediker. Stanley is part of the international group of scholars who from the early 1980s opened up the subject of gender and the sea; they include Brit Berggren, Valerie Burton, Margaret S Creighton, Joan Druett, Lisa Norling and Suzanne J Stark.
Transport history, similarly, has recently turned towards pioneering women drivers, pilots and railworkers. Stanley's work on the sea parallels that of those path-breaking scholars such as Liz Millward on air; Margaret Walsh and Georgine Clarsen on roads; Helena Wojtczak and Dianne Drummond on rail.
She is also playing a prominent part in the recent move that connects queer studies to maritime history, along with the late US historian Allan Bérubé, and Swedish sociologist Arne Nilsson. Focusing on the mentalities of some such travellers, Stanley is experimenting with ideas about sex's connection of mobilities. She also argues that seafarers can be freshly understood using cultural studies lens connected with the gaze, identity, narrativity and auto/biography. Seafarers’ explorings of the world can express (and create) a desire to understand oneself through fresh eyes, and even try out ‘being’ a new self. Travelling can be a quest for all sorts of freedoms and knowledge, she holds.

== Service history ==
Assigned to the Atlantic Fleet, Reuben James was used in the Mediterranean Sea during 1921–1922. Reuben James went from Newport, Rhode Island, on 30 November 1920, to Zelenika, Yugoslavia, arriving on 18 December. During the spring and summer of 1921, it operated in the Adriatic Sea and the Mediterranean out of Zelenika and Gruz (Dubrovnik), Yugoslavia, assisting refugees and participating in postwar investigations. In October 1921 at Le Havre, it joined the protected cruiser Olympia at ceremonies marking the return of the Unknown Soldier to the U.S. At Danzig, from 29 October 1921 to 3 February 1922, it assisted the American Relief Administration in its efforts to relieve hunger and misery. After duty in the Mediterranean, it departed Gibraltar on 17 July.Based then at New York City, the ship patrolled the Nicaraguan coast to prevent the delivery of weapons to revolutionaries in early 1926. During the spring of 1929, it participated in fleet maneuvers that helped develop naval airpower. It was decommissioned at Philadelphia on 20 January 1931. Recommissioned on 9 March 1932, the ship again operated in the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, patrolling Cuban waters during the coup by Fulgencio Batista. It transferred to San Diego during 1934. After maneuvers that evaluated aircraft carriers, Reuben James returned to the Atlantic Fleet in January 1939.


=== World War II ===

Upon the beginning of war in Europe in September 1939, it was assigned to the Neutrality Patrol, guarding the Atlantic and Caribbean approaches to the American coast. During March 1941, Reuben James joined the force established to escort convoys sailing to Great Britain. This force escorted convoys as far as Iceland, after which the convoys became the responsibility of British escorts. It was based at Hvalfjordur, Iceland, commanded by Lieutenant Commander Heywood Lane Edwards.On 23 October, it sailed from Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland, with four other destroyers, escorting eastbound Convoy HX 156. At dawn on 31 October, it was torpedoed near Iceland by German submarine U-552 commanded by Kapitänleutnant Erich Topp. Reuben James had positioned itself between an ammunition ship in the convoy and the known position of a German ""wolfpack"", a group of submarines poised to attack the convoy. The destroyer was not flying the Ensign of the United States, and was in the process of dropping depth charges on another U-boat when it was engaged. Reuben James was hit forward by a torpedo meant for a merchant ship and her entire bow was blown off when a magazine exploded. The bow sank immediately. The aft section floated for five minutes before going down. Of a crew of seven officers and 136 enlisted men plus one enlisted passenger, 100 were killed, leaving only 44 enlisted men and no officers who survived the attack.

After Estonia regained its independence, the kroon was reintroduced in 1992 and replaced by the euro in 2011.


== First kroon, 1928–1940 ==


=== History ===
The kroon became the currency of Estonia on 1 September 1928 after having been a unit of account since 1924. It replaced the mark at a rate of 100 mark = 1 kroon. The kroon was subdivided into 100 sent.
In 1924, the kroon was pegged to the Swedish krona at par, with a gold standard of 2480 kroon = 1 kilogram of pure gold. The standard received real coverage with the reserves backing the kroon. The issue of treasury notes and exchange notes was terminated. In order to secure the credibility of the kroon, the Bank of Estonia exchanged kroon for foreign currency. All these measures restored confidence in the domestic banking and monetary sector, contributing to the economic reinvigoration of the country and to the improvement of the reputation of the Estonian state in the international arena.
During the Great Depression in 1933, the kroon went off the gold standard, devalued 35% and obtained a currency peg with the Pound sterling (GBP) at 1 GBP = 18.35 kroon. The Estonian kroon kept this peg and circulated until the Soviet occupation of 1940. The kroon was exchanged for the Soviet ruble at a rate of 1 ruble = 0.8 kroon.


=== Banknotes and coins ===
In 1928, the first coins of this currency were issued, nickel-bronze 25 senti pieces. These were followed by bronze 1 sent in 1929, silver 2 krooni in 1930, bronze 5 senti and nickel-bronze 10 senti in 1931, silver 1 kroon in 1933, bronze 2 senti and aluminium-bronze 1 kroon in 1934, nickel-bronze 20 senti in 1935, nickel-bronze 50 senti in 1936.
On 25 July 1940, 4 days after the founding of the Estonian SSR, the last Estonian pre-WW II coin, the new 1 sent (date 1939), was issued.
In 1927, before the kroon was officially introduced, 100 marka banknotes circulated with an ""ÜKS KROON"" (1 kroon) overprint. Eesti Pank introduced 10 krooni notes in 1928, followed by 5 and 50 krooni in 1929, 20 krooni in 1932 and 100 krooni in 1935.


== Second kroon, 1992–2010 ==


=== History ===
The kroon was reintroduced as Estonia's currency on 20 June 1992, replacing the Soviet ruble at a rate of 1 kroon = 10 rubles. (Each person was able to change a maximum of 1500 rubles to 150 krooni.) Initially, the Estonian kroon was pegged to the Deutsche Mark at a rate of 8 krooni = 1 Deutsche Mark. After the introduction of the euro the fixed exchange rate of 1.95583 DEM to EUR led to an exchange rate of 15.64664 krooni to the euro. On 28 June 2004, as Estonia joined the ERM II-system, the central parity of the Estonian kroon was revalued (by less than 0.001%) to 15.6466 krooni per euro. On 1 January 2011 the euro replaced the kroon as the official currency of Estonia. The kroon circulated alongside the euro until 15 January 2011 at which point it ceased to be legal tender. However, the Eesti Pank will indefinitely exchange kroon banknotes and coins in any amount into euro.


=== Banknotes ===
In 1992, banknotes were introduced in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 100 and 500 krooni. Some of the 5, 10, 25, 100 and 500 krooni notes were dated 1991. In 1994, a 50 krooni note was introduced. Unlike others, the 1 kroon and 50 krooni notes were issued only once.
Notes in circulation before being replaced by the euro:

1 kroon (1992),
2 krooni (1992, 2006, 2007),
5 krooni (1991, 1992, 1994),
10 krooni (1991, 1992, 1994, 2006, 2007),

500 krooni (1991, 1994, 1996, 2000, 2007).


=== Coins ===
In 1992, coins were introduced (some dated 1991) in denominations of 5, 10, 20 & 50 senti, as well as 1 kroon. The 1 kroon was struck in cupronickel, the others in aluminum-bronze. However, in 1997, nickel-plated steel 20 senti were introduced, followed by aluminum-bronze 1 kroon in 1998. 5 senti coins were not issued after 1994 but were still legal tender. The cupronickel 1 kroon coins from 1992, 1993 and 1995 were demonetized on 31 May 1998 because they were too similar in weight and composition to German one-mark coins, and new 1 kroon coins were issued. The 5 krooni coins were commemorative pieces and were rarely seen in circulation.

The town had a population of 117 in the Canada 2021 Census.


== Geography ==
Its boundaries are established by the Town of English Harbour East Order under the Municipalities Act (Newfoundland and Labrador).


== History and Economy ==
Used by the Mi'kmaq in the years prior to European settlement, English Harbour East was permanently settled by the 1830s.In 1831, prominent Newfoundland fisherman Thomas Hynes, who defied the Bait Act, was born in English Harbour East. George Dodge of England and his family were residents by 1835.English Harbour East’s steady growth in the mid to late 19th century coincided with the success of the cod and herring fishery in Fortune Bay. Its residents were primarily fishermen and planters at the time. English Harbour East also significantly prospered in conjunction with the herring fishery and the sale of bait to United States traders. This was despite laws forbidding such action and the patrol of Fortune Bay waters by wardens who frequently (with little success) warned residents of the law and were on the receiving end of their ire. One such case was where the patrolling officer warned an offender named Hackett and reported in annoyance: “got a fair share of slang (abuse) here from sea-lawyer Hackett; 2 seines, 5 crafts."" During this period, a Way Office was established in 1883 on July 1, and a post office was created with the first Postmistress being Annie Hackett in 1891.
Beginning in the 1890s, the lobster fishery (including lobster factories) became a staple of income for many families in the town. In the first two decades of the 20th Century, salmon was also tinned by ambitious merchants. Many people moved to the area from such remote communities as Conne and New Harbour in the early to mid 20th Century.


=== Mass Exodus to Woods Island, Bay of Islands ===
Between 1897 and 1902, several dozens of families migrated from English Harbour East to Woods Island, Newfoundland and Labrador on Newfoundland’s west coast in search of a better herring fishery and living conditions.


=== 20th century ===
By the mid-late 20th century, many workers of English Harbour East were forced to commute to work from outside the town. This pushed five families from 1965 and 1975 to resettle to the nearby towns of Harbour Mille, Harbour Breton, and Terrenceville. Road construction to connect English Harbour East to nearby Grand Le Pierre for a distance of 6 miles began in 1970 and completed shortly thereafter at an estimated cost of $200,000.
The community was incorporated as a town in 1973 with residents mostly being employed in the fishery and a government wharf was built. This coincided with the addition of telephone service to the town that same year.
Vandalism became a serious problem in the small town in the mid-late 1990s as the school, several houses, and other buildings were broken into or damaged. In 1996, in response to various vandalism complaints, the community adopted the COPs program which was operated in July 1996 by resident Shirley Kearley. Kearley would patrol around the town and visit various buildings and vacant houses to help deter vandalism in the program which was the first of its kind for the Burin Peninsula.
In 2003, a complete waterfront infrastructure project was completed in the town to revitalize the fishing premises and government wharf area. This $600,000 retrofit including a concrete foundation rather than a wooden one.In the first decade of the 21st Century, several fishing sheds from abandoned communities elsewhere in Newfoundland were moved to English Harbour East and restored.


== Education ==
A Roman Catholic school was operating in English Harbour East by 1878.Throughout the later part of the 20th century, the community was formally served by St. George's School, which in 1981 had students from Kindergarten to Grade Nine, and high school students were bussed to the nearby St. Joseph’s school in Terrenceville. St. George’s School closed in 2006.


== Culture and Religion ==
Despite beginning in 1836 as a majority of Church of England settlement, by 1874, English Harbour East’s population was of majorly Roman Catholic residents.In 1975, resident Margaret Bolt explained that once a month the community would have a “time” or party where all of the residents would gather to socialize.


== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, English Harbour East had a population of 117 living in 48 of its 66 total private dwellings, a change of -15.8% from its 2016 population of 139. With a land area of 2.81 km2 (1.08 sq mi), it had a population density of 41.6/km2 (107.8/sq mi) in 2021.

List of poems by Catullus,"['Articles with short description', 'CS1 maint: location', 'CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list', 'Lists of poems', 'Poetry by Catullus', 'Short description is different from Wikidata']","This article lists the poems of Catullus and their various properties.

Catullus' poems can be divided into three groups:
the polymetrics (poems 1–60)
the long poems (poems 61–68)
the epigrams (poems 69–116)


== Historical context ==
Catullus (c. 84 BC - c. 54 BC) lived in the waning days of the Roman Republic, just before the Imperial era that began with Augustus. Catullus is the chief representative of a school of poets known as the poetae novi or neoteroi, both terms meaning ""the new poets"". Their poems were a bold departure from traditional models, being relatively short and describing everyday occurrences and intense personal feelings; by contrast, traditional poetry was generally large and epic, describing titanic battles among heroes and gods. These avant-garde poets drew inspiration from earlier Greek authors, especially Sappho and Callimachus; Catullus himself used Sapphic meter in two poems, Catullus 11 and 51, the second of which is almost a translation. His poems are written in a variety of meters, with hendecasyllabic verse and elegiac couplets being the most common by far.
Catullus is renowned for his love poems, particularly the 25 poems addressed to a woman named Lesbia, of which Catullus 5 is perhaps the most famous. Scholars generally believe that Lesbia was a pseudonym for Clodia and that the name Lesbia is likely an homage to Sappho, who came from the isle of Lesbos. Catullus is also admired for his elegies, especially Catullus 101 and Catullus 96, for his hymn to his homeland, Sirmio, in Catullus 31, and for his many depictions of everyday life in ancient Rome, such as Catullus 4, Catullus 10, and Catullus 13. Finally, he was well-nigh infamous even in his own time for his fierce, sometimes obscene, invectives against faithless friends (e.g., Catullus 12, Catullus 16, and Catullus 116), faithless lovers (Catullus 8, Catullus 30, Catullus 58, and Catullus 70), corrupt politicians (Catullus 28, Catullus 29), and bad poets (Catullus 14 and Catullus 44).
Catullus was admired in ancient times for his elegantly crafted poems, and inspired many of the next generation of poets, especially Ovid, Tibullus, and Sextus Propertius. Even Virgil and Horace are also known to have adopted some elements of his poetry, although the latter was also critical of his work. Martial seems to be the only later Latin poet to be influenced significantly by Catullus. Catullus is mentioned by a few other Roman scholars, such as Pliny the Younger and Quintilian, and by St. Jerome. Since Catullus' work was not adopted as part of a classical curriculum, it was gradually forgotten over time, although one Bishop Rather of Verona is said to have delighted in reading his poems c. 965 AD. That changed c. 1300 AD, with the discovery of a manuscript that contained 116 poems by Catullus.


== Manuscript tradition ==
Almost all of Catullus' poems survived from antiquity in a single manuscript discovered c. 1300 in the Chapter Library of Verona, conventionally called ""V"" for the ""Verona codex""; legend has it that the manuscript was found underneath a beer barrel. Two copies were made from the V manuscript, which was then lost. One of the copies was itself copied twice, after which it was lost in turn. Hence, Catullus' works depend on three surviving copies of the single V manuscript. The first printed edition (edito princeps) of Catullus appeared in Venice in 1472; the following year, Francesco Puteolano published the second printed edition in Parma.
For fourteen centuries (c. 1st century BC- c. 14th century AD), the poems of Catullus were copied by hand from other hand-written copies, a process that gradually led to a few errors in the received text. Scholars have applied methods of textual criticism to undo these errors and reconstruct Catullus' original text as much as possible. As an early example, Puteolano stated in the second edition (1473) that he made extensive ""corrections"" of the previous (1472) edition. In 1577, J. J. Scaliger published an emended version of Catullus' works, using the then novel genealogical method of textual criticism. Scholars since then have worked to emend these reconstructions to approximate more closely the original poems of Catullus; examples of these variant readings and emendations are given in the footnotes to the text below.


== Main list ==
The table below lists all of Catullus' extant poems, with links to the full text, the poetic meter, the number of lines, and other data. The entire table can be sorted according to any column by clicking on the arrows in the topmost cell. The ""Type"" column is color-coded, with a green font indicating poems for or about friends, a magenta font marking his famous poems about his Lesbia, and a red font indicating invective poems. The ""Addressee(s)"" column cites the person to whom Catullus addresses the poem, which ranges from friends, enemies, targets of political satire, one sparrow and, of course, Lesbia.

Its summit lies in the Austrian state of  Tyrol.


== Location ==
The mountain lies 4½ kilometres as the crow flies north-northwest of Steeg in the Lech valley and 14 kilometres south of Oberstdorf. Neighbouring peaks are, to the northeast the Wilder Mann, the Bockkarkopf, the Hochfrottspitze and the Mädelegabel. To the south are the Peischelspitze and the Ellbognerspitze, to the west the Hochgundspitze and the Hochrappenkopf. To the northwest lies the 200 metre lower Rotgundspitze.


== First climb ==
In 1854, during a triangulation exercise, a ""survey signal"" (Vermessungssignal) was erected. When the mountain was first climbed for leisure purposes by Hermann von Barth on 6 August 1869, the signal was still there. Barth reached the summit approaching from the Biberkopf via the Hochalpe and the Steinscharte from the northwest. This is still the normal route today.


== Bases and tours ==
A suitable base for ascending the Hohes Licht along the normal route, the easiest ascent, is the Rappensee Hut to the northwest at 2,091 metres. From the hut the summit may easily be climbed in 1½ hours. The route runs over the 2,262-metre-high (7,421 ft) wind gap of Große Steinscharte, that marks the border between German and Austria, and over the West Flank (Westflanke) to the top.
In 4½ hours the Hohes Licht can be reached from the Hochalptal valley from Steeg (to the south). The height difference for this tour is 1,527 metres. This ascent is also suitable for ski touring in spring.

He lived much of the latter half of his life in Buxton, Maine, USA, recording the faces of much of Maine's elite society of his time.
According to the website of the Fenimore Art Museum in Cooperstown, New York, ""Brewster was not an artist who incidentally was Deaf but rather a Deaf artist, one in a long tradition that owes many of its features and achievements to the fact that Deaf people are, as scholars have noted, visual people.""

He lived much of the latter half of his life in Buxton, Maine, USA, recording the faces of much of Maine's elite society of his time.
According to the website of the Fenimore Art Museum in Cooperstown, New York, ""Brewster was not an artist who incidentally was Deaf but rather a Deaf artist, one in a long tradition that owes many of its features and achievements to the fact that Deaf people are, as scholars have noted, visual people.""


== Family and early life ==

Little is known about Brewster's childhood or youth. He was the third child born in Hampton, Connecticut, to Dr. John and Mary (Durkee) Brewster. His mother died when he was 17. His father remarried Ruth Avery of Brooklyn, Connecticut, and they went on to have four more children.John Brewster Sr., a doctor and descendant of William Brewster (pilgrim), the Pilgrim leader, was a member of the Connecticut General Assembly and also active in the local church.

One of the younger Brewster's ""more touching and polished full-length portraits"" is of his father and stepmother, according to Ben Genocchio, who wrote a review of an exhibition of Brewster's portraits in the New York Times. They are shown at home in conventional poses and wearing refined but not opulent dress in a modestly furnished room. His mother sits behind her husband, reading while he is writing. ""She stares directly at the viewer, though softly, even submissively, while her husband stares off into the distance as if locked in some deep thought.""Being Deaf from birth, and growing up in a time when no standardized sign language for the Deaf existed, the young Brewster probably interacted with few people outside of the circle of his family and friends, with whom he would have learned to communicate. A kindly minister taught him to paint, and by the 1790s he was traveling through Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, and eastern New York State, taking advantage of his family connections to offer his services to the wealthy merchant class.His younger brother, Dr. Royal Brewster, moved to Buxton, Maine in late 1795. The artist either moved up with him or followed shortly afterward and painted likenesses in and around Portland in between trips back to Connecticut.


== Work as a Deaf artist ==

Brewster probably communicated with others using pantomime and a small amount of writing. In this way, Brewster managed the business of arranging poses along with negotiating prices and artistic ideas with his sitters. As an itinerant portraitist working in the late 18th and early 19th centuries in the United States, he would travel great distances, often staying in unfamiliar places for months at a time.His Deafness may have given Brewster some advantages in portrait painting, according to the Florence Griswold Museum exhibit web page: ""Unable to hear and speak, Brewster focused his energy and ability to capture minute differences in facial expression. He also greatly emphasized the gaze of his sitters, as eye contact was such a critical part of communication among the Deaf. Scientific studies have proven that since Deaf people rely on visual cues for communication [they] can differentiate subtle differences in facial expressions much better than hearing people.""


== Influences ==
Brewster's early, large portraits show the influence of the work of Ralph Earl (1751–1801), another itinerant painter. Paintings by the two artists (especially in Brewster's early work) show similar scale, costumes, composition and settings, Paul D'Ambrosio has pointed out in a catalog (2005) for a traveling exhibition of Brewster's work,""A Deaf Artist in Early America: The Worlds of John Brewster Jr.""Earl was influenced by the 18th century English ""Grand Manner"" style of painting, with its dramatic, grand, very rhetorical style (exemplified in many portraits by Thomas Gainsborough and Sir Joshua Reynolds. Earl and Brewster refashioned the style, changing it from lofty and grand to more humble and casual settings.


== Career ==

In the early 19th century, Brewster habitually painted half-length portraits which saved him labor, saved his patrons money and ""were better suited to his limited abilities,"" according to Genocchio. Some of the paintings are almost identical, down to the same clothes and furniture, with only the heads setting them apart.In 1805 his brother, Dr. Royal Brewster, finished construction of his Federal style house in Buxton, and John Brewster moved in. For the rest of his life, he lived in the home with his brother's family.By about 1805, Brewster had his own style of portraying children in full length, with skimpy garments or nightclothes, soft, downy hair and big, cute eyes for a  sweet, appealing affect. But the perspective problems remained, with the figures seeming out of scale with their environment.At about this time the artist also began to sign and date his paintings more frequently. He also moved away from the large-format Grand Manner-influenced style and turned to smaller, more intimate portraits in which he focused more attention on the faces of his subjects.In the years just before 1817, Brewster traveled farther for clients as his career flourished.


== Francis O. Watts with Bird ==

Typical of Brewster's portraits is ""Francis O. Watts with Bird"" (1805), showing ""an innocent looking boy with manly features"" wearing a nightslip and holding a bird on his finger and with a string. The surrounding landscape is ""strangely low and wildly out of scale—the young boy towers over trees and dwarfs distant mountains. He looks like a giant,"" Genocchio has written. Or he looks as if the viewer must be lying down, looking up at the child from the ground. Brewster always struggled with the relationship of his figures to the background.A more positive view of the portrait comes from the Web page about the 2006 exhibit at the Florence Griswold Museum website: ""Brewster’s serene and ethereal portrait of Francis O. Watts is one of his most compelling portraits of a child. In this work—particularly Francis’ white dress and the peaceful landscape he inhabits—modern viewers often feel a palpable sense of the silence that was Brewster's world.
""The bird on the string symbolizes mortality because only after the child’s death could the bird go free, just like the child’s soul. Infant mortality was high during Brewster’s time and artists employed this image often in association with children.""


== In school ==

From 1817 to 1820, Brewster interrupted his career to learn sign language at the newly opened Connecticut Asylum in Hartford, now known as the American School for the Deaf.Brewster, at age 51, was by far the oldest in a class of seven students, the average age of which was 19. It was the first class that attended the school and witnessed the birth of American Sign Language (ASL).


== Later life ==
When Brewster returned to Buxton and to his portraits, ""he seems to have taken more care when painting the faces of his subjects,"" Genocchio wrote,"" resulting in portraits that show an increased sensitivity to the characters of his subjects.""After the 1830s, little is known of Brewster's work—or of Brewster. He died in Buxton on August 13, 1854.


== Assessments of Brewster's artistry ==

Brewster ""created hauntingly beautiful images of American life during the formative period of the nation,"" according to a page at the Fenimore Art Museum website devoted to a 2005–2006 exhibition of the artist's work. ""Working in a style that emphasized simpler settings [than the ""Grand Manner"" style], along with broad, flat areas of color, and soft, expressive facial features, Brewster achieved a directness and intensity of vision rarely equaled.""
The Fenimore website also says, ""His extant portraits show his ability to produce delicate and sensitive likenesses in full-size or miniature, and in oil on canvas or ivory. He was especially successful in capturing childhood innocence in his signature full-length likenesses of young children.The website says Brewster left ""an invaluable record of his era and a priceless artistic legacy.""
According to the anonymous writer of the Florence Griswold Museum's web page about the same exhibit, ""Brewster’s Deafness may also have shaped his mature portrait style, which centers on his emphasis on the face of his sitters, particularly the gaze. He managed to achieve a penetrating grasp of personality in likenesses that engage the viewer directly. Brewster combined a muted palette that highlights flesh tones with excellent draftsmanship to draw attention to the eyes of his sitters. The importance of direct eye contact to a Deaf person cannot be overstated.""The same writer also says, ""Brewster was one of the greatest folk painters in American history as one of the key figures in the Connecticut style of American Folk Portraiture. In addition, Brewster’s paintings serve as a key part of Maine history. Brewster was the most prolific painter of the Maine elite, documenting through the portraits details of the life of Maine’s federal elite.""
Genocchio, reviewing the exhibit for the New York Times, took a dimmer view, noting Brewster's difficulty with painting backgrounds but admiring his ""sweetly appealing"" paintings of children.

== From infancy to national success ==
NBC was the first major television network to cover an NFL game, when on October 22, 1939, it broadcast a game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Brooklyn Dodgers; the network was still only in its infancy, with only two affiliates, the modern day WRGB (now a CBS affiliate) in Schenectady and W2XBS in New York City. Portions of that game still survive via films, but the film is not footage from the telecast (recordings of television broadcasts did not begin until 1948). The use of a sideline camera, the sole camera used in the 1939 broadcast, would become the standard for all future NFL broadcasts until 2017; the angle is particularly suited for estimating yardage, compared to more mobile camera angles that began to appear in the 21st century.Regular broadcasts of games began after World War II and the first NFL championship to be televised was the 1948 match between the Eagles and Chicago Cardinals.
In 1950, the Los Angeles Rams and the Washington Redskins became the first NFL teams to have all of their games—home and away—televised. In the same year, other teams made deals to have selected games telecast. The DuMont Network then paid a rights fee of US$75,000 to broadcast the 1951 NFL Championship Game across the entire nation.
From 1953 to 1955, DuMont also televised Saturday night NFL games. It was the first time that NFL fixtures were broadcast live, coast-to-coast, in prime time, for the entire season. The broadcasts ended after the 1955 season, when the DuMont Network folded. DuMont was a less than ideal partner for NFL broadcasts: with only eighteen affiliates in 1954, it was dwarfed by the amount of coverage the ""Big Four"" (later the East Division of the Canadian Football League) had with its contract on NBC, which had 120 affiliates at the time.DuMont also had Sunday regional coverage alongside ABC, in both instances the games being negotiated by the teams as opposed to the league as a whole. DuMont focused on teams that played in markets that had one of the network's O&O's and offered regional coverage of the New York Giants (WABD, now WNYW), Pittsburgh Steelers (WDTV, now KDKA-TV), and Washington Redskins (WTTG). ABC opted to go by region, initially offering the Chicago Bears and Chicago Cardinals nationally before relegating them to mostly Midwestern markets while offering the Los Angeles Rams and San Francisco 49ers for Western markets and the Redskins for Eastern and Southern markets; DuMont replaced the Redskins with the Philadelphia Eagles in its rotation.
By 1955, DuMont was in terminal decline following a merger attempt with ABC being vetoed by DuMont shareholder Paramount Pictures out of antitrust concerns (Paramount had spun off United Paramount Theaters by order of the United States Department of Justice, with UPT subsequently buying ABC) and selling off WDTV to Westinghouse Broadcasting. This led to the 1955 NFL season having erratic broadcasting contracts, with the Giants, Eagles, & Steelers remaining on DuMont, the Bears, Cardinals, Rams, & 49ers remaining on ABC, the Cleveland Browns (one of the league's most successful and popular teams) and Redskins (the only team at the time representing the South) having their own regoinalized coverage, and the Baltimore Colts (who despite also geographically being in the South represented the more Northeastern-like Baltimore) and Detroit Lions (despite the presence of then-ABC O&O WXYZ-TV) restricted to their home markets. The Green Bay Packers had no local television coverage, due to playing in both the smallest market in the major professional sports leagues (Green Bay-Appleton is ranked 69th nationally as of 2021; Buffalo is the next-smallest hosting a major professional team at 53.) as well as the team's own fight for survival in an (ultimately successful) fight with the league, who tried to force the team to move to the larger Milwaukee market if a new stadium wasn't built.
Later in 1955, NBC became the televised home of the NFL Championship Game, paying $100,000 to the league. The 1958 NFL Championship Game played at Yankee Stadium between the Baltimore Colts and the New York Giants went into sudden death overtime. This game, since dubbed the ""Greatest Game Ever Played,"" was watched widely throughout the country and is credited with increasing the popularity of professional football in the late 1950s and early 1960s.
CBS began to televise selected NFL regular season games in 1956.
By 1959, big-market teams such as the Bears and Giants had all their games televised, but small-market ones like the Packers and 49ers still did not. Upon becoming NFL commissioner, Pete Rozelle worked to ensure that every team got all its games on TV.


== War with the AFL ==

When the rival American Football League (AFL) began in 1960, it signed a 5-year television contract with ABC. This became the first cooperative television plan for professional football, through which the proceeds of the contract were divided equally among member clubs. ABC and the AFL also introduced moving, on-field cameras (as opposed to the fixed midfield cameras of CBS and the NFL), and were the first to have players ""miked"" during broadcast games. As the AFL also had players' names stitched on their jerseys, it was easier for both TV viewers and people at the games to tell who was who.
As of the 1961 season, CBS held the rights to all but one of the NFL's teams; the Cleveland Browns had a separate contract with Sports Network Incorporated (SNI) to carry their games over a regional network. However, the Browns and SNI were forced to break their deal when the NFL and CBS devised their own revenue sharing plan after CBS agreed to telecast all regular season games for an annual fee of $4.65 million. A special antitrust exemption, the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961, was passed in Congress to accommodate the collective contract, which restricted what days the league could televise their games. CBS' fee later increased to $14.1 million per year in 1964, and $18.8 million per year in 1966.
With NBC paying the AFL $36 million in 1965 to televise its games, and the intensified battle over college prospects, both leagues negotiated a merger agreement on June 8, 1966. Although they would not officially merge into one combined league until 1970, one of the conditions of the agreement was that the winners of each league's championship game would meet in a contest to determine the ""world champion of football.""
The first AFL-NFL World Championship Game was played on January 15, 1967 between the NFL champion Packers and the AFL champion Chiefs. As CBS held the rights to nationally televise NFL games and NBC had the rights to broadcast AFL matches, it was decided that both would cover that first game. The next three AFL-NFL World Championship Games, the initial Super Bowls, were then divided by the two networks: CBS broadcast Super Bowls II and IV while NBC covered III.


== Post AFL–NFL Merger ==
When the AFL and the NFL officially merged in 1970, the combined league divided its teams into the American Football Conference (AFC) and the National Football Conference (NFC). It was then decided that CBS would televise all NFC teams (including playoff games) while NBC would be responsible for all AFC teams. For interconference games, CBS would broadcast them if the visiting team was from the NFC, and NBC if the visitors were from the AFC. The two networks had a rotation policy for the Super Bowl.
ABC also agreed to televise one regular season game per week on Monday night. ABC aired its first edition of Monday Night Football on September 21, 1970. MNF pushed the limits of football coverage with its halftime highlights segment, occasional banter from Howard Cosell and Don Meredith, and celebrity guests such as John Lennon, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bill Clinton. During its 36-year run on ABC, Monday Night Football consistently ranked among the most popular prime time broadcasts each week during the season.
As the league's broadcasters, ABC, CBS, and NBC had their own talent. Announcers such as Cosell, Frank Gifford, and Al Michaels (from ABC); Pat Summerall and John Madden (from CBS); and Curt Gowdy, Dick Enberg, Marv Albert, Jim Simpson, Kyle Rote and Jim Lampley (from NBC), all had their own unique analysis of the game. Individual networks had distinctive innovations in their coverage. For example, CBS' The NFL Today was the first pre-game show to have a female co-host (Phyllis George). On December 20, 1980 NBC made history by broadcasting a game between the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins with no announcers. NBC has also tried one-announcer football when Dick Enberg called the New York Jets' visit to Cleveland Browns on December 12, 1981 without his regular colleague Merlin Olsen in accompaniment. NBC instead pre-recorded interviews with players and coaches from both teams which filled in the parts where Olsen would have spoken.
On December 27, 1987, NBC introduced the first female play-by-play football announcer in Gayle Sierens, who partnered with Dave Rowe in a game between the Seattle Seahawks and Kansas City Chiefs; contractual issues with her main employer prevented Sierens from calling any further games for the network, and it would be another 29 seasons before the next female announcer, Beth Mowins, began calling games for both ESPN and CBS in 2017.
In 1978, the NFL increased its revenue from both ticket sales and TV by expanding the regular season from 14 games to 16. Furthermore, the playoff format was expanded from 8 teams to 10 teams, enabling the league to give another post-season game each to CBS and NBC. This was partially due to the league's 1976 expansion to 28 teams.
Meanwhile, the Super Bowl became a yearly ratings blockbuster, allowing the broadcasting network to generate millions of dollars in advertising revenue. Four of the ten highest rating television broadcasts of all-time (in the U.S.) are Super Bowls. When the league signed a new 5-year TV contract with the three networks in 1982, it allowed ABC to enter into the Super Bowl rotation; Super Bowl XIX was ABC's debut. Since then, the network that televises each Super Bowl is determined by the contracts that the league negotiates with all of its broadcasters. Each network broadcaster generally gets one Super Bowl before any received a second.  This process repeats before any network airs a third event, although the TV contracts usually expire by that time.


== Expansion to cable and satellite TV ==
Cable TV became commonplace during the 1980s, and the NFL was eager to exploit that opportunity in 1987.
In 1986, the United States Football League, at the time pursuing an antitrust lawsuit against the NFL, signed an agreement with ESPN to carry games on Sunday nights. When the lawsuit failed and the 1986 season was canceled, the NFL swooped in and took the time slot, creating ESPN Sunday Night Football in 1987. ESPN thus became the first cable network to broadcast regular season NFL games. Chris Berman helped redefine the pre- and post-game shows when he launched NFL Countdown and NFL Prime Time, and they have since become the top-rated pre- and post-game shows on television. The cable network's contract to show ESPN Sunday Night Football was one of the turning points in their growth, transforming them from a small cable network to a marketing empire.
When ESPN first started televising NFL games in 1987, it only broadcast Sunday night games during the second half of the season. Meanwhile, ABC, CBS, and NBC maintained their rights to Monday Night Football, the NFC, and the AFC, respectively.
By 1990, Turner's TNT network started to broadcast Sunday night games for the first half of the season. The combined 1990 contracts with ABC, CBS, ESPN, NBC, and TNT totaled $3.6 billion ($900 million per year), the largest in TV history. One major factor in the increased rights fee was that the league changed the regular season so that all teams would play their 16-game schedule over a 17-week period. ABC was also given the rights to televise the two Saturday games on the opening weekend of the postseason. This was made possible after the league expanded its playoff format to include more teams.
TBS had also broadcast the infamous 1982 ""strike"" games. The NFLPA called for a players' strike three weeks into that season which reduced it to nine games. In October, two ""all-star"" exhibition games were held with generic NFC and AFC teams in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. and aired on TBS. Ratings and attendance at both games was minimal.
In 1994, the league signed an exclusivity agreement with the direct broadcast satellite (DBS) service DirecTV to launch NFL Sunday Ticket, a satellite television subscription service that offers every regular season NFL game.


== Broadcast realignments ==


=== NFL leaves CBS after 38 years ===
When contracts were signed in December 1993, CBS (which had been home to NFC games for 38 years) lost their rights to the fledgling Fox Network, and it just so happened that CBS also lost its MLB coverage (which it never recovered) after that same year. Fox offered a then-record $1.58 billion to the NFL over four years, significantly more than the $290 million per year offered by CBS. Fox was only seven years old and had no sports division, but it began building its own coverage by hiring many former CBS personalities such as Summerall and Madden.
Fox's NFL rights ownership made the network a major player in American television by attracting many new viewers (and affiliates) and a platform to advertise its other shows. In the meantime, CBS lost several affiliates (mainly owned by New World Communications in NFC markets) to Fox, and ratings for its other offerings languished. CBS lost a number of affiliates, primarily in Atlanta, Detroit, and Milwaukee, where it was dropped to lower-powered UHF affiliates unable to be received in some areas.
Due to satellite television, the NFL Sunday Ticket in local markets, and rules of the time, satellite subscribers were required to use antennas to pick up local affiliates. CBS was devastated by the loss of over-the-air availability of these stations in the outer reaches of some markets. Since 1994, the situations in Milwaukee and Atlanta have improved due to committed station ownerships and acquisition of high-profile syndicated programming, along with the digital transition equalizing the field into being received via UHF-only, while CBS's Detroit station continues to struggle for relevancy and exists mainly as an automated pass-through for CBS programming, along with shows from the network's syndication arm, CBS Television Distribution.
ABC, NBC, TNT and ESPN renewed their contracts in the meanwhile. TNT was able to get a stipulation that the Atlanta Falcons, based in Turner's home of Atlanta, be featured on TNT once a year, regardless of the previous season's record.


=== NBC temporarily loses the NFL ===
Meanwhile, NBC's rebound in the overall ratings in both the 1980s and 1990s after years at the bottom of the ratings were partly attributed to its continuing coverage of the NFL. With television contract re-negotiations in early 1998 ushering in the era of multibillion-dollar broadcasting agreements, an era of pro football broadcasting was about to end. CBS, stung by Fox's surprise bid four years earlier, aggressively sought to reacquire some broadcasting rights. CBS agreed to pay $4 billion over eight years ($500 million per season) to air AFC games.
NBC, meanwhile, had indicated a desire to bid for Monday Night Football rights in 1998, but gave up when the financial stakes increased sharply. Thus, after six decades, NBC, the network that had shaped television broadcasts of football, lost its rights, thus marking the beginning of a slow decline for its sports division, culminating in the unproductive 2004–05 primetime season, when NBC carried no major sporting championships during prime time (NBC had already lost Major League Baseball broadcasting rights in 2000 and National Basketball Association rights in 2002; they had acquired National Hockey League rights in 2004, but that league's entire 2004–05 season was canceled due to a lockout, and furthermore, it was the least popular of the major leagues at the time).
NBC's attempts to replace the NFL with other professional football, including the XFL in 2001 and the Arena Football League coverage from 2003 to 2006, proved to be very unsuccessful. Like CBS before it, NBC would later decide that not having NFL rights did too much damage to its overall ratings to justify foregoing the high rights fees required.
The other networks also signed eight-year deals in 1998. Fox extended its NFC deal by agreeing to a $4.4 billion contract ($550 million per season). ABC retained its longtime rights to Monday Night Football by also paying $4.4 billion over eight years. ESPN agreed to a $4.8 billion ($600 million a season) deal to become the sole cable broadcaster of NFL games, marking an end to the league's association with TNT. As with previous TV contracts, the coverage of the Super Bowl was divided between the broadcast networks.


== Kickoff Game ==
In 2002, the NFL began scheduling a Thursday night special opening ""Kickoff"" game, taking place on the Thursday after Labor Day leading into the opening Sunday slate of NFL games. The event includes a pre-game concert and other televised festivities. The first series of these events were held in New York and Washington, D.C., respectively, to celebrate both cities' resilience in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks. The 2002 San Francisco 49ers and the New York Giants game was held on September 5 and televised on ESPN. The 2003 edition featured the Washington Redskins hosting the New York Jets on September 4, 2003, and the game was televised by ABC. Since 2006, NBC has televised the Kickoff game (see below).
Starting in 2004, the NFL began awarding the opening game to the defending Super Bowl champions as the official start of their title defense. The unfurling of the team's Super Bowl championship banner in their stadium has become a centerpiece of the opening ceremonies.
In 2012, the kickoff game between the New York Giants and Dallas Cowboys aired on Wednesday, September 5, to avoid conflict with the final night of the Democratic National Convention in which incumbent president Barack Obama delivered his acceptance speech for the party nomination.On two occasions since 2004, the defending Super Bowl champion has not hosted the Kickoff Game:

In 2013, due to a scheduling and parking contract with baseball's Baltimore Orioles, the Baltimore Ravens played the Kickoff Game on the road against the Denver Broncos.
In 2019, the New England Patriots hosted the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday Night Football, with the Kickoff Game instead seeing the Chicago Bears host the Green Bay Packers.


== Financial losses lead to another realignment ==
Recently, the NFL's TV broadcasters have suffered annual financial losses because advertising revenue is unable to keep up with the rising costs of broadcast rights.
Nevertheless, the current broadcast contract, which began in 2006, resulted in a sizable increase in total rights fees. Both Fox and CBS renewed their Sunday afternoon broadcast packages through 2011, in both cases with modest increases. Furthermore, the league and DirecTV signed a five-year extension to their exclusivity deal on NFL Sunday Ticket.
Despite relatively high, if declining, TV ratings, ABC decided to end its relationship with the NFL after losing significant money on Monday Night Football. In addition to the fees, part of this decision may have been the result of a resurgent ABC prime time entertainment schedule during the 2004–05 season, particularly on Sunday evening with Desperate Housewives; thus ABC would be unable to satisfy the league's reported preference for a Sunday night game on broadcast television as opposed to Monday.
Because of that, Monday Night Football moved from ABC to ESPN, which are both owned by The Walt Disney Company. The cable network paid $1.1 billion per year from 2006 to 2014 for the rights. Unlike the broadcast networks, however, ESPN can generate revenue from subscription sales, in addition to traditional commercial breaks (ESPN's subscriber fees are the highest of any American cable network, more than four times that of second-place TNT). The cable network's coverage begins at 1:00 p.m. ET with SportsCenter Special Edition: Monday Night Kickoff. The 2009 edition saw the game itself start at 8:30 p.m., with Mike Tirico, Ron Jaworski, and Jon Gruden in the broadcast booths.
Meanwhile, NBC, after losing the AFC package to CBS in 1997, was able to reclaim some broadcast rights with a deal worth an average of $650 million per year to air the Sunday night package from 2006 to 2014 (not much more than what ESPN used to pay for the same rights). This new deal included the Super Bowl in 2009 and 2012.
NBC's coverage also includes two preseason games (including the annual Hall of Fame Game), the first two Wild Card playoff games of each post-season, and the annual Thursday opening Kickoff Game, similar to ABC's broadcast rights package. The major difference was that the NFL allowed NBC flexibility in selecting games in the latter part of the season. ABC did not have the right to be flexible with their Monday Night Football schedule and picked matchups based on a team's record in the previous season (as NBC does), which often led to teams with losing records playing each other on Monday night later in the season.
The moves were intended to break NBC out of its ratings slump; however, at one point in the last decade, this did not happen, and although NBC Sunday Night Football had been (and continues to be) the network's top rated program and in the top 30 for viewing audience, it had not lifted the rest of the schedule.  For a time, NBC had been firmly in fourth place and was losing large sums of money, so much so that the network had to cut an hour of prime time programming from its weeknight schedule in favor of The Jay Leno Show, a somewhat lower budget talk show which lasted five months.  The network has since slowly come back to second place in the network ratings.
Coverage of NBC Sunday Night Football starts at 8:15 p.m. ET with Al Michaels serving as the play-by-play announcer, Cris Collinsworth as color commentator, and Michele Tafoya as the sole sideline reporter. Each telecast begins with a pre-game show airing at 7 p.m. ET entitled Football Night in America, hosted by Liam McHugh.
In addition, for the first three years of the contract, the network that carried the Super Bowl also broadcast the Pro Bowl on the Saturday night following the championship game. In 2007, CBS broadcast both games, followed by Fox in 2008, and NBC in 2009.  In 2010, the Pro Bowl was played the weekend before the Super Bowl, broadcast by ESPN.  The 2010 deal was meant as a one-time situation to protect the Winter Olympics in Vancouver that started the next week (as well as the NBA All-Star Game and the Daytona 500), however the NFL would have the Pro Bowl regularly be played one week before the Super Bowl there after. 
The NFL Network was created by the league in 2003 and given a separate package of broadcast games. The eight-game package consisted of prime time games which in 2006 and 2007 began airing from Thanksgiving to the end of the regular season. Five games aired on Thursday nights and three on Saturday nights, the latter beginning Week 15 of the season. Starting in the 2008 season the ratio and dates of the games changed: now there are seven Thursday night games beginning in the first week of November and continuing to Week 16. There is only one Saturday night game, airing during Week 15 or 16 (usually 16, but when Saturday is Christmas Eve, it airs in week 15). The NFL could theoretically decide to sell this package to another network should NFL Network broadcasts not generate enough revenue. NFL Network will also carry several preseason games. The introduction of the NFL Network games also marked the end to late-season Saturday afternoon regular season games on the networks that aired Sunday afternoon games: CBS, Fox and NBC.


== 2011 and beyond ==
ESPN renewed its contract with the NFL in 2011 which extends to ESPN the NFL broadcast rights through the 2021–22 season. ESPN increased the purchase price for the eighteen-game package, which will include in 2015 the Pro Bowl. Cable television operators condemned the contract, noting that ESPN has the highest retransmission consent fees of any national cable television channel, nearly five times higher than the nearest competitor (TNT), and raises fees on an annual basis. Nevertheless, the other networks had intended to follow suit by renewing their contracts through 2021–22, increasing their price to over $1 billion per year. The remaining networks announced they had indeed renewed with the NFL on December 14, 2011. Both the new ESPN and broadcast deals take effect in 2014-15 and will continue through Super Bowl LVI in 2022.As for the rest of the changes, they consist of the following:

NFL Network will televise 13 (later increased to 16, then 18) Thursday Night Football games from Week 2 through Week 15 not including the Week 12 Thanksgiving night game on NBC.  All teams will play one nationally televised Thursday game during the season and 26 teams (all except the Dallas Cowboys and the Detroit Lions who always play on Thanksgiving, whoever their opponents are in a given year, and the two teams that play in NBC's Thanksgiving game) will appear on the NFL Network's Thursday Night Football. (This stipulation is no longer strictly enforced; in 2017, two of the teams that played on Thanksgiving faced off in the next week's Thursday Night game.) The Kickoff Game does not count towards each team's allotment of one Thursday game per year.
Saturday night was briefly returned to the other networks as a ""flex night"" to accommodate holidays and other scheduling conflicts; ESPN used a Saturday game (Falcons at Lions) on December 22, 2012, to avoid playing a game on Christmas Eve as it was forced to do in 2007. It was during that Falcons-Lions game that Detroit's Calvin Johnson set an NFL record for most receiving yards in a season (he finished the season with 1,964 receiving yards). NFL Network later reclaimed Saturday nights as their own in 2017; by 2018, the league was again forced to schedule a game on Christmas Eve night because of this.
Flexible scheduling will begin earlier in the season and will allow games to be shifted between Fox and CBS as well as to NBC.  This will also help the mandate all 32 teams will appear on CBS and Fox at least once each year if possible.
Beginning in 2014–15, NBC will only televise one Wild Card Weekend game, choosing instead to add a divisional round game. The additional wild card game was picked up by ESPN, which, beginning in 2015–16, will return that game to ABC, returning that network to NFL coverage for the first time in a decade; ESPN will still air the game itself as well.  This change also eliminated two issues with the Wild Card game directly relating to syndication of cable games.A team that did not appear on Monday Night Football during the season could be playing in the Wild Card game.  Since the NFL only sells syndicated packages to teams that play a Monday night game during the season, the logistics selling a sealed bid package of a single playoff game to local television stations on Monday morning for a Saturday game would be improbable.  While in 2014, both Carolina and Arizona played on Monday during the season, the stations with the Monday night package were able to air the game in the local markets.
The logistics of the local rights holder having to clear up to four hours of air time (some of which may have already been sold for infomercials) for the game, and sell all of the local advertising breaks, within a five-day notice also played into the move to an ABC deal.
NBC's Spanish-language channels (originally reported as being over-the-air network Telemundo, but later changed to cable-only mun2) began a Spanish language simulcast of Sunday Night Football. (Prior to this, Telemundo had aired Spanish commentary on the second audio program of the main NBC channel, but not on Telemundo itself.)
NBC Sports Network was originally to begin airing a competing Sunday morning pregame show going against ESPN Sunday NFL Countdown in 2014–15. (This never materialized, due to the channel's rapid shift in direction toward English soccer by the time of the fall 2014 season and heavy competition from other unofficial NFL preview shows on ESPN, Fox Sports 1 and CBS Sports Network.)
ESPN will regain exclusive rights to the Pro Bowl, should the game be continued (the league has considered discontinuing the contest), beginning in 2014–15. Beginning in the 2017–18 season, this game will also be simulcast on ABC.In addition to that, all of the networks were afforded the rights to stream games on the Internet via the TV Everywhere initiative, but not to mobile devices (as Verizon Wireless, through its NFL Mobile app, maintained exclusive rights to all devices 7 inches (18 cm) or smaller through the 2017 season); the streaming rights are effective immediately, as NBC and Verizon both carried Super Bowl XLVI online for the first time. NBC is paying an average annual rights fee of $950 million for its broadcast rights; CBS $1 billion, and Fox $1.1 billion; the actual amount is slightly lower at the beginning of the contract and higher at the end to compensate for inflation.On February 5, 2014, the league announced it had sold off eight weeks of the NFL Network's Thursday Night Football package to CBS, who outbid competitors ABC, Fox, NBC, and Turner Sports. NFL Network will simulcast CBS' Thursday night games from weeks 2 through 8, will continue to carry the Thursday night games from Week 9 onward, and will also carry two Saturday night games (Week 16 doubleheader) for the first time since 2011, with one of those games being simulcast on CBS.All of these games (except for the one NFL Network-only Saturday night game) will be announced by CBS' lead commentating team of Jim Nantz (play-by-play) and Phil Simms (color analyst). The deal with CBS was initially only for the 2014 season, with the league having the option to extend it for an additional season. CBS is paying an additional $275 million for the package. Local CBS affiliates automatically get the local simulcast rights to any game carried only on NFL Network. The league exercised the option to extend its agreement with CBS through the 2015 season.For 2016 and 2017, the league split a ten-game package of Thursday night games between NBC and CBS, with each paying an estimated $225 million per season for five games; CBS's games were in the early part of the season as before, while NBC's games were later in the season. Under the terms of NFL Network's retransmission agreements with cable providers, the NFL has included a stipulation requiring seven games in the Thursday Night Football package to be carried solely on NFL Network; for the 2018 season, potential bidders were free to place a bid on a package ranging from anywhere between four and eleven games. Fox, the winning bidder, bought all eleven games that were up for bids. As the eighteen total games involve more time slots than can be accommodated with the fourteen Thursday night time slots (excluding the kickoff, Thanksgiving, and the last week of the season when no Thursday game is played), four of the games are played on days other than Thursdays (usually this involves at least one game in London in a Sunday morning time slot and the remainder on Saturdays, all NFL Network exclusives), or if Christmas lands on a Monday, either a Christmas Eve or Christmas Day game.


=== Digital rights ===
Verizon has held rights to carry video simulcasts of NFL games to devices 7 inches (18 cm) or less since such simulcasts have been viable. The company initially made these telecasts available only to its own wireless service subscribers, even going so far as to block the networks from providing their own feeds to those devices. Beginning in 2018, at the league's behest, it broadened the availability to all devices of that size and offered them through a newly acquired subsidiary, Yahoo! Sports. (Yahoo! has twice carried exclusive NFL games, both based in London, which were available to larger devices as well.) At the same time, Verizon dropped its prohibition on the networks offering the feeds to small devices. Verizon's NFL feeds are limited to Sunday and Monday nights, plus the locally telecast game in the phone's location (determined by the phone's GPS locator); Verizon offers Thursday night games but will only stream those games over a mobile data connection, whereas other games streamed through Verizon can use Wi-Fi.
The Thursday Night Football contract, uniquely among the league's television packages, has a separate digital contract allowing games to be carried freely to all Internet devices since 2016. Twitter carried the 2016 season before being outbid in 2017 by Amazon, who has held the rights since. For the 2017 season it required an Amazon Prime subscription to access the streams; it began offering the streams freely through its gaming-centric streaming service Twitch in 2018.

== Meaning in different languages ==
The name is used in several languages, among them Slovak, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish, Bosnian, Macedonian, Bulgarian and Croatian.
In some languages people with the name are sometimes named after the cross, not after Christ. The word cross in Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbian is kr'st and in Russian is krest, in some cases pronounced krist. In contrast Christ in these Slavic languages is called Hristos, which confuses to which of both nouns the name sounds more similar. The name may have a third meaning in Bulgarian and Macedonian, in which the word kr'sten means baptized and has the same  as the word for cross.Though sounding similar, the words cross and Christian have different roots, Christian derives from the Koine Greek word Christós, possibly ultimately derived from the Egyptian kheru, ""word"" or ""voice"", used to replace the Biblical Hebrew term mashiach, ""anointed"". On the other the hand the Slavic and the English word for cross comes from the Latin word crux (cruci) ""stake"" which is perhaps of Phoenician or Punic (Phoenicio-Carthaginian) origin. It may come from the Latin word crio, ""to torment"".

He was the City of London surveyor and architect from 1735 until his death.


== Life ==
Originally a mason, George Dance was appointed Clerk of the city works to the City of London. In 1734, shortly before taking up the post, he had won a major commission from the city, for the Mansion House, the new residence for the Lord Mayor.  He was one of three architects—the others being James Gibbs and Giacomo Leoni—who had been invited to submit designs. His building has a grand portico, and an ""Egyptian Hall"", so called because it uses an arrangement of columns described as Egyptian by Vitruvius. It was completed in 1752.
He also designed the Great Synagogue of London as well as the churches of St Leonard's, Shoreditch (1736–40), St Botolph's Aldgate (1741–44) and St Matthew's, Bethnal Green (1743–46). Further afield, Dance designed the Town Hall of Coleraine in Northern Ireland (1743; demolished in 1859).
Sir John Summerson included Dance in a list of London architects who he felt debased Palladianism, calling his Mansion House ""cramped and overdressed"".George had five sons, three of whom enjoyed fame in their own right. 

Eldest son James Dance (1722–1744) became an actor and playwright connected with Drury Lane theatre, and took the name Love.
Second son Giles
Third son Sir Nathaniel Dance-Holland (1735–1811) was a notable painter.
Fourth son William, ""an ingenious modest man, is in a private situation. With a talent for musick, & much ingenuity He has attempted to get a living by miniature painting & by teaching as a School Master. Lord Camden knows him &, being at a Concert given by his Brother Sir Nathaniel, conceived the reason to be his situation in life. His Lordship soon after had a Concert & invited Sir Nathaniel & William who made an excuse, which His Lordship saw through & put off the day of his Concert. William was obliged to attend to the 2nd invitation & gave Lord C. an opportunity of showing an attention that the Brother had not.""
Fifth son George Dance the Younger (1741–1825) succeeded him as city architect.Dance is buried in the churchyard of St Luke's Old Street, north of the City of London.

== Route ==

The main railway would run 146 km from Lothair in Mpumalanga in South Africa to Sidvokodvo Junction in Eswatini. This would reduce the pressure on the Richards Bay line, removing general freight traffic, hence allowing more coal export trains and reducing the volume of coal transported by road.  There are also plans for 600 km of connecting railways, and this route fits with several other Transnet infrastructure projects which concentrate on coal transport. This would also allow further development of the railway which takes coal from the Waterberg Coalfield via Ermelo to Richards Bay; the Waterberg coalfields have South Africa's biggest undeveloped coal reserves.


== Project ==
The project officially began in January 2012 and was initially expected to cost between R15bn and R17bn, with the South African government paying up to R12bn. The Swazi government suggested that PPP would be used, or another source of external funding. The Lothair - Sidvokodvo line itself was forecast to cost R7.3 billion, and another R8.6 billion would be spent on connecting railways. The first trains were expected to start running in 2015 or 2016.In July 2014, Swazi Railways estimated that the link would cost R17 billion and could enter service in 2017.Transnet is acquiring General Electric locomotives for the line.

== Origin ==
In June 1991, Craig McCracken, a student of the animation program of CalArts, initially created a drawing of three girls on a small sheet of orange construction paper as a birthday card design for his brother. The following year he included the two girls as the main characters of his short film Whoopass Stew! The Whoopass Girls in: A Sticky Situation. This was intended to be part one of four Whoopass Girls shorts, but only one was produced. McCracken felt that he wanted to make a superhero student film but felt that the muscular guy standard was already played out. Then after drawing the three little girls he started imagining them in superhero situations. McCracken's Whoopass Girls short was picked up for a series by Cartoon Network in 1993. After the name Whoopass was dropped for Powerpuff to include it in the What a Cartoon! showcase, The Powerpuff Girls then appeared in two What a Cartoon! shorts before receiving their own series.


== Characters ==


=== The Powerpuff Girls ===
As depicted in the opening sequence of each episode, the Powerpuff Girls, Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup, were created by Professor Utonium in an attempt to create the ""perfect little girl"" using a mixture of ""sugar, spice, and everything nice"" (shown in respective fields of sky blue, lime green, and bright pink). However, he accidentally spilled a mysterious substance called ""Chemical X"" into the mixture, creating, instead of the ""perfect little girl"", three girls (each possessing one of the above elements dominating her personality), and granting all three superpowers including flight, superhuman strength, super speed, limited invulnerability, x-ray vision, super senses, heat vision, and energy projection. In the original pilot, the accidental substance was a can of ""Whoopass"", which was replaced by ""Chemical X"" in the aired version.The three girls all have oval-shaped heads, abnormally large eyes (inspired by Margaret Keane's art), stubby arms and legs, and lack noses, ears, fingers, necks, and flat feet with toes (McCracken preferred them to look more symbolic of actual girls rather than going for a ""realistic"" look, meaning fewer body parts were needed). They wear dresses that match the colors of their eyes with black stripes, as well as white tights and black Mary Janes.


==== Blossom ====

Blossom (voiced by Cathy Cavadini in the What a Cartoon! episodes and the series) is the tactician and self-proclaimed leader of the Powerpuff Girls. Her personality ingredient is ""everything nice"", her signature color is bright pink, and she has long red-orange waist-length hair with bangs in a triangular part with a red bow and a pink hair clip with a red heart. She was named for having spoken freely and honestly to the Professor shortly after her creation as shown in The Powerpuff Girls Movie. She is often seen as the most level-headed, intelligent, and composed member of the group and also strong and determined. She is also a master strategist and apt planner. Her unique power is freezing objects with her breath as seen in the episode ""Ice Sore"".
In Powerpuff Girls Z the anime version of Blossom is named Momoko Akatsumi (赤堤 ももこ, Akatsumi Momoko) / Hyper Blossom (ハイパー・ブロッサム Haipā Burossamu) in the original Japanese version while being called Blossom in the English dubbed version. She is depicted as the first member of the Powerpuff Girls Z. She uses a yo-yo as her signature weapon, but she can use her bow as a weapon if she doesn't have her yo-yo. Like the original, she's the self-proclaimed leader of the team. However, she is extremely ditzy, a bit boy-crazy, given to crushes and romantic fantasies. She is very familiar with the mahou shojo genre, along with some typical anime/super sentai concepts and is regarded as a ""hero maniac"" in school, especially by Buttercup. Blossom also has a strong appetite for sugary foods. Blossom was the first to encounter Mojo Jojo at the park after buying candy. If she doesn't eat sweets for a long time she can get very cranky. But she is getting used to it. Although often distracted and has been known to whine, Blossom tries her best to protect New Townsville, lead the girls, and help her friends regardless of her situation. (In one instance, when Blossom is unable to transform, she tries to fight alongside Bubbles and Buttercup wearing a sentai hero mask). Often she can be very clever and crafty when needed, usually being the first to come up with a plan to trick or defeat a monster that the girls are having trouble with. She has a younger sister named Kasey.
In the reboot and Lego Dimensions, voiced by Amanda Leighton, the 2016 version of Blossom is once again depicted as the leader of the Team. Her appearance is similar to her original counterpart with the exception of her bow, which is more rounded. She loves organization and hates when things are messy and out of order. She has a perfect attendance record and is an overachiever. She can be stubborn at times, but still comes through. She also has ice breath like her 1998 counterpart. Her trail is bright pink with little squares. Her unique abilities are: Ice breath, genius-level intelligence, microscopic vision, natural leadership skills, and intuitive aptitude. She also can project bright pink energy and manipulate it into various household and office items; an ability her 1998 counterpart in the original show does not possess.


==== Bubbles ====
Bubbles (voiced by Tara Strong in the series, and by Kath Soucie in the What a Cartoon! episodes) is the ""softest and sweetest"" of the three. Her signature color is blue, her personality ingredient is ""sugar"", and she has blonde hair in pigtails. Bubbles is seen as kind and very sweet but she is also capable of extreme rage and can fight monsters just as well as her sisters can. Her best friend is a stuffed octopus doll she calls ""Octi"", and she also loves animals. She exhibits the ability to both understand multiple languages and communicate with various animals; her unique powers are projecting powerful sonic screams, and creating a shockwave of thunder with a single clap from her hands.
In Powerpuff Girls Z the anime version of Bubbles is named as Miyako Gōtokuji (豪徳寺 みやこ Gōtokuji Miyako) / Rolling Bubbles (ローリング・バブルス Rōringu Baburusu) in the original Japanese version while she is still named Bubbles in the English dubbed version. She is depicted as the second member of the Powerpuff Girls Z team who uses a bubble wand as her signature weapon. Compared to her original counterpart, who is known for being the most childish of the three, Bubbles is comparatively mature and often acts as the mediator in many situations and tries to calm her teammates down when in such situations. However, she is the ditziest member of the team, often appearing a bit clueless, and doesn't seem to understand her powers completely, along with a few other things. She is also very polite and always uses honorifics at the end of names and ends most of her sentences with ""desu wa"". She is more concerned with shopping, her appearance and her outfits, and perhaps because of this, she seems to be very popular among her male classmates. While she seems oblivious to the many boys that love her, she's already in love with a boy named Cody, a boy on whom she has had a crush ever since she was six years old. She retains her hairstyle during the reimagining, but her pigtails are slightly longer, and curl into ringlets. She also uses curlers (3 balls on each pigtail) when going to bed. Like her American counterpart, Bubbles is a compassionate, gentle and innocent character, possessing a love for animals and her favorite doll, Octi (her American counterpart has the same octopus doll of the same name). She is represented by bubbles.
In the reboot voiced by Kristen Li, the 2016 version of Bubbles has shoulder-length blonde hair in pigtails just like her original counterpart, except with new blue hair ties and the pigtails being set slightly higher-up than previously. Bubbles is an animal lover like her 1998 counterpart and usually tries to save the day the nice way. Like her 1998 counterpart, she can be a bit naive but can also get angered very easily. When in bed she has Octi by her side. Her trail is blue with little circles. In ""Viral Spiral"", she is shown to have talent with computers and can even create and program her own video games which have become extremely popular among the children in Townsville, including her sisters. Her special abilities include: Animal telepathy, animal empathy, zoolingulism, sound manipulation, sonic waves, sonic blasts, vocal mimicry, hypnotic singing, and multilingualism. She also can project bright blue energy and manipulate it into various animals due her love for them; an ability her 1998 counterpart in the original show does not possess.


==== Buttercup ====
Buttercup (voiced by E. G. Daily) is described as a ""tough hotheaded tomboy"". Her personality ingredient is ""spice"", her signature color is green, and she has short black hair in a flip. She loves to get dirty, fights hard and plays rough; she does not plan and is all action. Her unique powers are to curl her tongue, and creating fireballs by rubbing her hands together 'till smoke comes out which forms a flaming ball that she throws at an opponent. McCracken originally wanted to name the character ""Bud"" until a friend suggested the name Buttercup. According to The Powerpuff Girls Movie, Buttercup really dislikes the name she was given.
In Powerpuff Girls Z the anime version of Buttercup is named as Kaoru Matsubara (松原 かおる Matsubara Kaoru) / Powered Buttercup (パワード・バターカップ Pawādo Batākappu) in the original Japanese version and is still just named Buttercup in the English dubbed version. She is depicted as the third and final member of the Powerpuff Girls Z who uses a giant mallet as her signature weapon. Like the original Buttercup, she is a tomboy and is the most easily enraged of the three. Buttercup is known at school for being the most athletic girl as she plays tennis, practices martial arts, and numerous other activities, and spends a great deal of time watching sports on television. She is especially good at soccer due to her strengthened determination after receiving new soccer cleats when she was younger. This may be part of the reason why she has so many fangirls, much to her dismay. She detests anything girly, particular skirts, which makes wearing the Powerpuff uniform a bit more awkward. She speaks with a hard and masculine edge and rarely uses honorifics when speaking. Buttercup lives with her parents and her two brothers, the father of which is a professional masked-wrestler. She is represented by stars.
In the reboot voiced by Natalie Palamides, the 2016 version of Buttercup's appearance is almost exactly like her original counterpart except she has a cowlick on the back of her head. She is depicted as a tomboy who loves to get into action and likes to play sports, hanging out with boys and having fun like her 1998 counterpart, She has a fear of spiders like her 1998 counterpart as well. She has a temper that can usually get out of control. She is also the main archenemy of Manboy, who called her ""princess"", which she hates the most, Blossom and Bubbles attempt to stop her. Her trail is green with little triangles. Unlike her two sisters, she does not possess any special abilities of her own. However, she, like her sisters, can project bright green energy and manipulate it into various weaponry; an ability her 1998 counterpart and her sisters in the original show does not possess. She also excels at mathematics in ""Buttercup vs. Math"".


==== Blisstina ""Bliss"" ====

Blisstina ""Bliss"" (voiced by Olivia Olson, Toya Delazy, Wengie and  Alesha Dixon) is the original Powerpuff Girl in the 2016 series, and is referred to as the fourth one because she is the fourth Powerpuff Girl to be shown in the reboot. She first appears in the five-part special, ""The Power of Four"". Her hair color is electric blue, and she often wears a pastel blue hairband with a pink heart adorned upon it. In two flashbacks depicting events that occur ten years prior to the main events of the series, Professor Utonium attempts to create the perfect little girl in response to his rival Newtronium creating the perfect little boy; Utonium uses sugar, spice, and everything nice. However, he accidentally adds Chemical W to the concoction, thus creating Bliss. Mojo Jojo also considered himself Bliss' childhood friend when he was the Professor's lab assistant. Bliss possesses superhuman strength, supersonic flight, superhuman hearing, laser vision, and limited invulnerability. However, unlike Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup and their original 1998 counterparts, Bliss also possesses psionic abilities, but her powers are uncontrollable due to her emotions. As such, in a flashback scene, Bliss' powers caused the destruction of the Professor's residence after she throws a temper tantrum, and the Professor ends up unconscious. Bliss then flies off to Bird Poop Island to keep everyone safe from her superpowers (Mojo himself was saddened to see Bliss run away) and meets her pet elephant, Mee. After spending several years on Bird Poop Island, Bliss moves back to Townsville; after saving the girls from being beaten by the Gnat, she is considered a hero and gets some training to control her powers. But the Professor dismisses her from ever using her powers again, as he insists that she is not ready yet. However, Mee convinces Bliss to prove him wrong as the girls invite her to defeat Chipmunk Commando. Her anger gets the best of her, as she almost hurts the girls, and Mee reveals that he is in fact Him in disguise. He manipulates her into fusing with him, and causes mayhem in Townsville within Bliss's body. But she then breaks free from Him's body thanks to Mojo Jojo, who tries to get her to notice him but fails. Bliss, Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup then combine together by the power of sisterhood to defeat Him.
Because of the planet Saturn being moved closer to Earth, Bliss leaves to bring it back to its rightful place in the Solar System. She also pledges to come back to see Utonium and the Powerpuff Girls again when she is done.


=== Secondary characters ===


==== Professor Utonium ====
Professor Utonium (voiced by Tom Kane) is a scientist who works in his home in the suburbs of the City of Townsville, and the Powerpuff Girls' creator and father. A stereotypical scientist, his general attire is a white lab coat and black pants. The Professor once housed a chimpanzee named Jojo (later to become Mojo Jojo) as a lab assistant who proved to be reckless and destructive. While the Professor was stirring his perfect girl concoction, Jojo shoved him, causing him to accidentally break a flask containing the mysterious ""Chemical X"" which spilled into the formula, thus creating the Powerpuff Girls. The Professor is a genius in many fields of science, has shown knowledge in fields such as physics, chemistry, and biology as well as being a skilled inventor. Aside from his role as a scientist, he acts as a parent to the Powerpuff Girls. Although he apparently did not legally ""adopt"" the girls, everyone who addresses him calls him ""their father"" and they as ""his daughters"". The Professor can be strict, easily manipulated, and overprotective at times, but still retains his caring fatherly image. In the episode ""Keen for Keane"", the girls set up Professor Utonium and their kindergarten teacher Ms. Keane on a date for Valentine's Day, resulting in the two temporarily becoming an item.
In Powerpuff Girls Z, Professor Drake Utonium (ユートニウム博士, Yūtoniumu-Hakase) (voiced by Taiten Kusunoki and Louis Chirillo) has a son named Ken Kitazawa, who is responsible for all those affected by the Chemical Z lights, especially the Powerpuff Girls Z. Professor Utonium was originally experimenting with the substance Chemical X and strove to find a way to change its chemical properties. Professor Utonium has created several inventions throughout the series; the most important one being his Chemical Z Particle Ray, which allows him to transform those affected by the lights back to normal (although it doesn't prevent recurring transformations nor is it able to work on all black light victims). He seems to be aware of the effect Ken's lack of a mother has had on his son, assuming that it had caused him to be a bully to the girls. However, this does not change his behavior towards Ken. He appears to be a gentle father figure like the original Professor Utonium was in The Powerpuff Girls. He treats the girls as members of his family and is very close to the Mayor and Miss Bellum. While he is very gentle and serious, Professor Utonium may, at times, act a little less mature than he usually does. In episode 37, when the Powerpuff Girls Z are ""grounded"" from using their powers for a day when they have to take a test in school, Professor Utonium fills in for them, donning an exo-suit with a laser beam gun and rocket pack, calling himself ""Professor Puff Z"" (this is most likely based on the American cartoon episode ""Powerprof"" in which he also donned a fighting suit but drove the girls crazy with lame one-liners during battles). He also appears to have a mecha that looks like Professor Puff Z, which he uses against the Mojo Robo. Although he seems unsuccessful at first, he is able to defeat Mojo Jojo, Fuzzy Lumpkins, and the Amoeba Boys. His main attack is the Uto Beam. At the end of the episode, Ken, Peach, and himself call themselves ""Powerpuff Boys Z"" as their own self-proclaimed superhero team.


==== Mayor ====
 The Mayor of Townsville (voiced by Tom Kenny in the series and by Jim Cummings in the What a Cartoon! episodes) is generally referred throughout only as ""Mayor"", although he is referred to as ""Barney"" by his wife in the episode ""Boogie Frights"". He is short and elderly with a fringe of white hair around a bald scalp and a thick white mustache. He wears a monocle over his left eye and a small top hat that “floats” just above his head. The Mayor is rather dimwitted but cares deeply about his city. He has a love for pickles and is very childish at times. He sometimes calls the girls for very silly reasons, as seen in the episode ""Bubblevicious"" when he calls because of a traffic jam. The What a Cartoon! episode ""Meat Fuzzy Lumpkins"" featured a different Mayor who was younger, taller and more competent than the Mayor of the series.
In Powerpuff Girls Z, the Mayor Mayer (メイヤー市長, Meiyā Shichō) / of New Townsville (Tokyo City) (voiced by Hideyuki Tanaka and Alec Willows) is of normal height and has no monocle or top hat. While less extreme in comparison to the Mayor of Townsville, the Mayor is very childish and has a very short attention span. He seems to worry quite a lot when the girls are fighting and wishes that they could cause a little less damage. The Mayor, like many of the characters in the anime, loves sweets. The Mayor also has a younger brother, who is the Principal of the school. It was through him that Miss Bellum and the Mayor were able to rearrange the classes so that the girls would be in the same class. However, the Mayor and the Principal, don't always get along, and even the most minor of things will set off an argument, which often time leads to name-calling. He also deals with his brother when the girls aren't doing well in class due to them skipping class to save the city.


==== Ms. Bellum ====
Ms. Sara Bellum (voiced by Jennifer Martin in the series) is the Mayor's secretary, who often handles issues that the Mayor cannot (and in a way is the one really in charge of Townsville). She has long, curly red hair, wears a red business suit and red high heel shoes for a secretary look. Her face is never fully shown onscreen, although The Powerpuff Girls Rule!!! revealed part of it. Running gags include other onscreen characters often finding her attractive, the camera focusing on her chest, and her face always being obscured. Her name is a pun on the word cerebellum presumably due to her intelligent and wise nature. She also proved to be a capable fighter, battling the villain Sedusa by herself when the girls were disabled.
In Powerpuff Girls Z, Sara Bellum (ミス・ベラム, Misu Beramu) (voiced by Youko Kawanami and Nicole Oliver) has blonde hair compared to the original's red hair. Usually, Sara Bellum covers her face with a tablet computer, which has lipstick imprinted on it. While the mayor is different from his original counterpart and is more competent, Sara Bellum in the anime still does most of the mayor's work for him in a manner similar to the original Sara Bellum, and still appears to be the brains of the operation.
Miss Bellum appears in one episode of 2016 series in a cameo appearance, and will be portrayed by Robyn Lively in the Powerpuff live-action reboot.


==== Ms. Keane ====
Ms. Keane (voiced by Jennifer Hale and by Kath Soucie in the What-a-Cartoon! episodes) is the kindergarten teacher of Pokey Oaks Kindergarten. She wears an orange shirt, a red vest, brown pants, and has short black hair and light blue eyes. She is patient, wise, understanding, and protective of her students, making her a well-liked, motherly figure. She is also an animal lover, owning a ginger cat named Valentino, and the class pet hamster, Twiggy. Ms. Keane forbids any fighting in school, even if there is a crisis taking place within it; she convinces the girls that there are other ways to solve problems other than fighting as demonstrated in the episodes ""Schoolhouse Rocked"" and ""Imaginary Fiend"". She is named after Margaret Keane who was the main influence behind the design of the Powerpuff Girls.
In Powerpuff Girls Z, Miss Keane (キーン先生, Kīn-sensei) (voiced by Tomoko Akiya and Tabitha St. Germain) is the girls' primary and secondary school teacher who is very pretty and loved by her male students, although the female students don't like her as much, especially Princess Morbucks. Like the original, she is kind and incredibly patient.


==== Narrator ====
Narrator (voiced by Tom Kenny in the series and Craig McCracken in Whoopass Stew and by Ernie Anderson in the What a Cartoon! episodes) is the enthusiastic but unseen narrator of the show. He often comments on the proceedings of the episode, says things which happen to be hints about the plots of certain episodes, and frequently breaks the fourth wall. He is also shown to be the only connection between the audience and the girls, as he can ""talk"" to both and even be involved, such as Mojo Jojo transforming him into a dog. In the episode ""Simian Says"", he is kidnapped by Mojo Jojo, who promptly takes his place as the episode begins.


==== Talking Dog ====
Talking Dog (voiced by Tom Kane in the series and by Paul Mercier in the What a Cartoon! episodes) is a small white dog with black ears and nose and a black spot on his back, wearing a red collar with a yellow dog tag. When he stays with the girls he is shown to be blunt, abrasive and insulting, though his demeanor remains straightforward and earnest. He is frequently abused in almost every appearance he makes; as a running gag, no one ever seems to regard his pain and simply ignores him.


==== Mitch Mitchelson ====
Mitch Mitchelson (voiced by Tom Kenny): The bully at Pokey Oaks Kindergarten. Mitch has brownish hair, and wears a black T-shirt with the words ""MITCH ROCKS"" on the front. Usually talks in a gruff voice; he torments the kids in the class in a few episodes, though he is not a major threat. He is Buttercup's close friend, according to Buttercup in her interview in the DVD features of The Powerpuff Girls Movie. For a brief time he hosted a short segment on Cartoon Network called ""Mitch Rocks"", where he looked at various things and said whether they ""rock"" or not.


==== Ken Kitazawa ====
Ken Kitazawa (北沢 ケン, Kitazawa Ken) (voiced by Makiko Ohmoto and Cathy Weseluck) is Professor Utonium's eight-year-old son who is somewhat responsible for turning regular girls into the titular Powerpuff Girls Z in Powerpuff Girls Z, and numerous other characters into villains using Chemical Z. He used it to blast a glacier in order to set the weather back to normal, but the impact resulted in the explosion of several lights, which affected all those who came in contact with it. Despite being younger than the girls, he acts a lot more mature and the education he receives from his father is considered more advanced than what the girls learn in their school, earning his PhD at an early age. Ken, in a later episode, attended school in order to gain social skills and make friends. While he considers grade school life boring, he has made several friends, including Jou, who was originally his rival and Kuriko who is Momoko's young sister. Ken sees the girls as older sisters and has to often put up with them, though he still cares for them deeply. Ken interchanges between calling Professor Utonium ""Dad"" and ""Professor"". During a serious situation (such as a monster attack or investigation) he will try to refer to Utonium as ""Professor,"" but in less serious situations (like packing a lunch) he will call him ""Dad."" Ken often corrects himself, because he usually uses the wrong honorific (e.g. ""Dad, I mean, Professor""). In the twenty-sixth episode, it is revealed that Ken's mother works on a space station, therefore making her very busy and unable to be with Ken. Thanks to the girls and Santa Claus (whom he believed did not exist at first based on a 70% possibility), he was able to see her and is now able to communicate with her clearly on the lab's monitor. In episode 37, when the Powerpuff Girls Z are ""grounded"" from using their powers for a day when they have to take a test in school, Ken fills in for them, donning a superhero suit consisting of a black bodysuit, a white cape, white gloves, white boots, a red vest with gold shoulder pads and a yellow ""Z"" on it, and a blue helmet with the yellow letters ""KK"" on it, while brandishing a blue polearm with a yellow ""U"" at the end, and calling himself ""Kamikaze Ken Z"". Despite having no powers or attacks, he uses traps and other props as weapons when he defends their lab from the Gangreen Gang, ultimately driving them off by tricking them into drinking bottles of hot sauce (thinking they were the containers of Chemical Z). Ken's pre-production art bears a strong resemblance to Dexter from Dexter's Laboratory, even the current incarnation. However, in one of the special edition booklets, it is explained the design originated from Kid Utonium from the original series.


==== Peach ====
Peach (ピーチ, Pīchi) (voiced by Tomoko Kaneda and Matt Hill (ep 1-37a), Simon Hill (ep 37b-52)) is Ken's pet robot dog who was also affected by a white Chemical Z ray, gaining the ability to talk, as well as a considerable boost in intelligence. Peach's shout prompts the girls to transform either in person or through a long-distance communication device, although a modification to the girls' compacts allows them to transform on their own. Additionally, Peach can re-summon the girls' powers, even when their powers are drained. Peach is also capable of sniffing out those who are affected by the black rays, white rays, and Him's black particles. The black ray monsters/villains that have been sniffed by Peach are stored in his data banks for later reference. This ability, however, is hindered if his target is wearing heavy cosmetics (as was the case with Sedusa). Peach is also capable of sniffing and identifying others more clearly than other dogs, even when someone's appearance has been completely changed.


==== The Derbytantes ====
The Derbytantes (voiced by Kate Higgins and Jessica DiCicco (Maylyn)) are a group of bad girl roller skaters who Buttercup usually likes hanging around with. Introduced in the 2016 series, they never take their skates off and enjoy playing ""Deathball"" (a sport resembling a cross between dodgeball and Rollerball). Notable members include: Maylyn (the leader, with pink hair and lightning bolts on her uniform), Jaylyn (blue hearts), Haylyn (yellow hearts) and Bobby Susan Ray-Lyn (who looks more like a grown man).


==== Donny ====
Donny (voiced by Josh Fadem) is a young unicorn who is best friends with Bubbles. Introduced in the 2016 series, Donny is originally that unaware they are unicorn because of the thick hair on their head but still seeks to become one by having Professor Utonium transform them into one.


=== Villains ===


==== Mojo Jojo ====
Mojo Jojo (voiced by Roger L. Jackson) is a mad scientist anthropomorphic chimpanzee with great intelligence, who speaks with a Japanese accent in an overly redundant manner. As the main antagonist of the series and the Powerpuff Girls' archenemy, Mojo Jojo was Professor Utonium's reckless laboratory chimpanzee, Jojo, before Professor Utonium created the Powerpuff Girls; the same accident that created the Girls gave Jojo his super-intelligence. He has green skin, pink scleras, and wears a white glass dome-shaped helmet that covers his oversized, protruding brain. He wears white gloves and boots, a blue suit with a white belt, and a flowing purple cape. Despite his high intelligence, his plans often contain flaws that he overlooks, and he rarely has much success against the Girls, as their superpowers are too much for his inventions. However, he is a master at manipulation and trickery, often fooling the Girls into thinking he has changed despite their constant encounters. Mojo lives in an observatory atop a dormant volcano located in the middle of Townsville's municipal park. In the 2016 series, Mojo has a mother who also appears to be evil.


==== HIM ====
HIM (voiced by Tom Kane) is a mysterious, sinister, effeminate, and supernatural demon. His physical appearance is an amalgamation of sorts with lobster-like claws, red/orange skin, pointed ears, a hooked nose, yellow/green eyes, a long curled beard, wearing makeup, a woman's red jacket and skirt, and black stiletto heel boots. His voice ranges from a high-pitched falsetto to a deep, booming basso profondo. HIM's plans are usually psychological in nature, and often consist of manipulating events to either drive the Powerpuff Girls insane or drive wedges between them. HIM possesses various supernatural and demonic abilities such as shapeshifting, mind manipulation, reality warping, various kinds of energy manipulation, and more. Craig McCracken has stated that the character ""HIM"" was inspired by the mannerisms of the Chief Blue Meanie in the 1968 film Yellow Submarine. McCracken also stated HIM is his favorite villain.


==== Fuzzy Lumpkins ====
Fuzzy Lumpkins (voiced by Jim Cummings) is a pink Bigfoot-like hillbilly monster with a wide jaw, a green nose, two antennas on his head, big blue overalls, and brown boots, who commonly plays a banjo which he calls ""Jo."" He was the first villain introduced in the series, appearing in the pilot ""Meat Fuzzy Lumpkins,"" in which he turned the people of Townsville into meat after he lost in a jam contest. He speaks in a southern accent, and lives in the woods next to Townsville. Fuzzy has a limited intellectual capacity, and is not nearly so active and ambitious as most of the villains in the series.  He usually limits himself to shooting anyone whom he finds trespassing on his property, though also prone to destructive fits of rage; when angry, Fuzzy turns dark red, grows claws, and his teeth become sharp fangs. Fuzzy (according to Professor Utonium's research) belongs to a race of ""Lumpkins""; he has three siblings (Furry, Fluffy, and Hairy), three nephews (Buzzy, Wuzzy, and Scuzzy), and several dozen cousins who closely resemble him.


==== Princess Morbucks ====
Princess Morbucks (voiced by Jennifer Hale) is a spoiled, rich, and bratty little girl, whose partially unseen and mostly mute father allows her to finance various evil plots to destroy the Powerpuff Girls. Her supervillain outfit consists of a yellow, Powerpuff-style dress, black gloves and boots, and a tiara. Her hatred of the girls stems from her rebuffed attempt to become one of them. Her father is ""Daddy"" Morbucks, a large, rotund man whose face and head are always hidden from the viewer. He dotes on his daughter and usually indulges in her whims, but it is hinted that his patience is limited and Princess fears truly angering him. Thanks to him, Morbucks has access to virtually unlimited financial resources. In the 2016 series, Morbucks is voiced by Haley Mancini and Kelsy Abbott, and seeks to kill and replace the Powerpuff Girls rather than simply join them.


==== The Gangreen Gang ====
The Gangreen Gang (sometimes referred as The Ganggreen Gang)A are a gang of five teenage hoodlums and punks who are green-skinned and unhealthy-looking. Not possessing any powers or exceptional abilities, the Gang is normally not too much of a threat to the girls, but have shown themselves to be very dangerous when motivated. They also delight in tormenting those weaker than themselves, especially children and the elderly. The Gangreen Gang lives in an old shack located in Townsville's junkyard.

Ace (voiced by Jeff Bennett): A mean-spirited and opportunistic rogue with a slick-back hairdo, a colored vest-jacket, a peach-fuzz mustache, a pair of shades, and also has fangs. As the Gang's leader and their smartest member, he is the instigator of most of their antisocial activities, and he does possess a certain charismatic charm that allows him to sweet-talk people who ought to know better, such as Ms. Keane in the episode ""School House Rocked"" and even Buttercup in the episode ""Buttercrush"". He speaks in a nasally Italian/New Yorker accent. In 2018, Ace temporarily became the replacement bassist of the virtual band Gorillaz while Murdoc Niccals was in prison.
Snake (voiced by Tom Kenny in the series): A slippery character with a forked tongue, skinny body, and a hissing voice, Snake is the Gang's second-in-command, but this mostly makes him a yes-man to Ace. He does have a personality of his own, but it is usually silenced due to Ace punching him when he speaks out of line (or asks a foolish question). It is revealed in ""School House Rocked"" that his real name is Sanford D. Ingleberry.
Lil' Arturo (voiced by Tom Kenny and by Carlos Alazraqui in his first appearance): A malevolent Mexican midget boy, Lil' Arturo seems to take the most amusement from the Gang's activities. In the episode ""School House Rocked"" he carries around a switchblade-styled comb he calls ""Maria"", a treasured gift from his incarcerated father. He has a rather prominent underbite. His full name is Arturo de la Guerra, which is Spanish for ""Arthur from the War"". His small size allows him to sneak through cramped spaces and passages that the rest of the gang cannot reach.
Grubber (voiced by Jeff Bennett): A barefoot hunchback with untidy hair, grubby clothes, and protruding eyes. He also appears to be mostly mute, communicating instead through blowing a raspberry. He does, however, occasionally demonstrate unexpected talents, such as playing the violin, speaking eloquently or performing impersonations. When attending the girls' school for a short time, Grubber showed that he was able to horribly contort his body, making him briefly resemble a well-spoken and handsome-looking young man before snapping back to his normal self.
Big Billy (voiced by Jeff Bennett): A hulking, dimwitted colossus who acts as the Gang's muscle. Though he does at times display a childlike innocence, he mostly just does the bidding of his more savvy and vindictive friends. In the episode ""School House Rocked"", it is revealed that his real name is William W. Williams and that he is a cyclops, with his single eye hidden beneath his shaggy red hair. Although he rarely fares any better in combat against the girls than the rest of the gang, he has the muscular power to stop a speeding train from running down citizens from the track and tackle monsters to the ground with his bare hands. He is fiercely loyal to anyone he considers to be a friend, and briefly tried to help the Powerpuff Girls after they saved him from a train. However, his clumsiness and lack of intelligence made him more destructive as a hero than he was as a villain.


==== The Amoeba Boys ====
The Amoeba Boys (voiced by Chuck McCann in the series and the What a Cartoon! episodes and by Lou Romano in Whoopass Stew) are a trio of amoebae who are the villains featured in McCracken's original short, Whoopass Stew in A Sticky Situation. They reappear in the What a Cartoon! short Crime 101. With their mobster affectations, these aspiring criminals would love nothing more than to be regarded as serious villains worthy of fighting, and even getting beaten up and sent to jail by the Powerpuff Girls. Unfortunately, their brains are too primitive to devise a crime above the level of littering or jaywalking. Indeed, they considered stealing an orange to be their greatest crime ever in the episode ""Divide and Conquer"". They are Townsville's least malicious villains, even having a friendship-of-sorts with the girls. They are generally harmless, but their actions have on occasion endangered both the girls and the town by accident.

Bossman: The leader and general spokesman of the Amoeba Boys. He wears a gray fedora. In the pilot Whoopass Stew in A Sticky Situation, he is depicted with a cigar in his mouth.
Junior: The smallest one of the Amoeba Boys. He wears a black cap and usually repeats whatever Bossman says. In the episode Crime 101, he is named Tiny.
Slim: The tallest one of the Amoeba Boys. He wears a brown fedora and is even slower and more incompetent than the other amoebas. In the episode Crime 101, he is called Skinny Slim.


==== Sedusa ====
Sedusa (voiced by Jennifer Hale in the series) is a young, beautiful Gorgon-like mistress of disguise and seductress who uses her feminine wiles to influence men to do her bidding, such as Professor Utonium, the Mayor, and the Gangreen Gang. When her identity is revealed, she typically doffs down to her leotard battle suit and fights with her prehensile hair. Her eyes also change color depending on her mood. When she is acting benevolent her eye color is green, but when she is angry, revealing her true villainous nature, her eyes turn red. Similar to Ms. Bellum, Sedusa is absent from the reboot due to female modifications.


==== The Rowdyruff Boys ====
The Rowdyruff Boys are the evil male versions of the Powerpuff Girls created by Mojo Jojo using a mixture of ""snips, snails, and a puppy dog tail"" and toilet water in the Townsville Prison in the episode called ""The Rowdyruff Boys"". The Rowdyruff Boys are essentially violent bullies who have the same powers as the Powerpuff Girls, with their own techniques as well. They were ultimately destroyed when the girls kissed them. After being resurrected by HIM in the episode ""The Boys Are Back in Town"", the Boys' hairstyles become noticeably spikier. The Boys wear long-sleeved shirts with a black stripe in each, black trousers and black, low-top sneakers with white laces and white soles.

Brick (voiced by Rob Paulsen in the series): Blossom's equivalent, he is the short-tempered, self-proclaimed leader of the Rowdyruff Boys. He has an abrasive and rash attitude, which often causes conflict with his brothers. He wears a backwards red baseball cap compared to Blossom's bow. He also originally had bangs, which were replaced with long spiky hair when he was revived.
Boomer (also voiced by Paulsen in the series): Bubbles' equivalent, he is a loud-mouthed dunce, as opposed to Bubbles' naïve sweetness, and has been known to like disgusting things. After his resurrection, Boomer is shown to be the least intelligent of the boys and he is often bullied and bossed around by his brothers. Boomer's hair parts in a curved fashion like Bubbles', but is longer and spiky on each end, in a wings haircut.
Butch (voiced by Roger L. Jackson in the series): Buttercup's equivalent. After his resurrection, Butch becomes more hyperactive and overly excited. Butch's hair is spiked upwards, abandoning his previous cowlick from his first appearance. He also shares Buttercup's small triangular hair parting.


==== Packrat ====
Packrat (voiced by Jason Spisak) is a scheming, oversized rat from the sewers. Introduced in the 2016 series, he loves stealing ""shiny things"" from stores and the people of Townsville, which he sees as gifts for various dolls he views as girlfriends. He broke Bubbles' arm in ""Strong Armed"". In ""Little Octi Lost"", he stole Octi from Buttercup.


==== Allegro ====
Allegro (voiced by Eric Bauza) is a happy party-obsessed, panda-like being who is capable of causing people to go into a stupor of pure happiness. Introduced in the 2016 series and based on Panda from We Bare Bears, another Cartoon Network series, his true form is a smaller blue bear. He is actually one half of an entity called the Cosmic Bear.


==== Manboy ====
Manboy (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) is a short man with super strength and a magical beard (similar to Sedusa's hair) and has a tall wood figure that he uses in battle. Introduced in the 2016 series, he is an enemy to the Powerpuff Girls, mainly to Buttercup, because he is incredibly sexist and constantly declares men are superior to women. He is eventually revealed to be a child who gained an adult body when he got his powers.


==== The Fashionistas ====
Bianca and Barbarus Bikini (voiced by Lily Vonnegut (Bianca) and Natalie Palamides (Barbarus' vocal effects)) are a stylish pair respectively consisting of a human and gorilla. Bianca was initially chosen to be the new assistant of the Mayor, before being found out. They have an offshore hideout. Bianca replaces Sedusa as the main villainess in the reboot.


==== Jemmica/Jemoir ====
Jemmica (voiced by Anais Fairweather) is a thief who presents herself as a treasure-hunting adventurer but had actually stolen artifacts from archeological digs. It is revealed in ""Total Eclipse of the Kart"" that she is actually ancient evil Jemoire, Queen of the Storms.


==== Silico ====
The mysterious villain Silico (voiced by Jason Spisak) first appears in the episode ""Viral Spiral"", where he offers the Amoeba Boys a way to destroy the internet and finally become big-name villains. In ""Halt and Catch Silico"", he uses a social media news website Muck Bucket to post false news stories about the Powerpuff Girls. The Powerpuff Girls confront him in his lair and he reveals that he was originally a lonely kid who built toy robot friends to keep him company, however, they were inadvertently destroyed when a monster the Powerpuff Girls defeated fell on his house, causing him to swear revenge against the Powerpuff Girls, whom he held responsible due to their carelessness. The Powerpuff Girls manage to defeat him when he unwisely calls Blossom ""unorganized"", but it turns out to be a hologram he created. In ""Take Your Kids to Dooms Day"", he steals a power suit to fight the Powerpuff Girls before being defeated by the Professor. In ""The Trouble with Bubbles"", he hacks a robotic clone of Bubbles to destroy the Powerpuff Girls, but Robo-Bubbles sacrifices herself to defeat him before she explodes. He survives an explosion and disguises himself as the Professor to replace him. In the Episode ""Lights Out!"", he disguises as Bliss and gave everyone in Townsville, the Butley. He shuts down the power, and mind-controlled everyone in Townsville to antagonize and destroy the Powerpuff Girls, even Bliss too. But was stopped by Bubbles by giving him a modified Butley, he appears to drop a bomb on the girls and leaves the library to explode. Later, he was escorted to jail for his crimes.

She admires the Powerpuff Girls Z and wishes to be a heroine just like them. She admires Rolling Bubbles and Powered Buttercup, but shows little favor for Hyper Blossom who, unbeknownst to her, is actually her own sister. She is also always looking for new ways to annoy her sister. She appears to be quite interested in Ken, especially when she realizes that he knows her sister. Similarly, Ken seems interested in her because of her resemblance to Blossom.

Voiced by: Misa Watanabe (Japanese); Cathy Weseluck (English)
Miyako's grandmother, who she lives with in a large traditional-looking house.

==== Tokio Matsubara ====
Tokio Matsubara (松原 時夫, Matsubara Tokio)
Voiced by: Keiichi Sonobe (Japanese); Brian Drummond (English)
Kaoru's father, a professional wrestler and loving family man who is never seen without his mask. He left for Mexico when Kaoru was young, and studied the art of the luchador after experiencing a losing streak that could have cost him his career. His teacher was severely injured in what is implied to be his final match. The Masked Mexico was given his teacher's mask, which in true lucha spirit, he never removes, except when taking a shower. Since then, Kaoru has forgotten what her father's face looks like. There is no photograph in their family album that shows what his real face looks like either, mirroring Miss Bellum's running gag. After he wins the match against Giant Panda Mask, Kaoru finally got to see her father's face for the first time since before he left for Mexico, which is reportedly 'very handsome.Michiru Matsubara (松原満, Matsubara Michiru)

==== Leading Girls of the Great Edo ====
Great Edo ChakiChaki Girls (大江戸ちゃきちゃき娘, Ōedo Chakichaki Musume, lit. ""Genuine Great Edoite Girls"" or ""Leading Girls of the Great Edo"")
Voiced by: Emiri Katou, Nami Miyahara, Machiko Kawana (Japanese); Nicole Bouma, Maryke Hendrikse, Kelly Metzger (English)
Three girls, Momo (もも), Omiya (おみや) and Okou (おこう), who protected Edo from Him, as revealed in the thirty episode, Edo eventually became Tokyo City. A long time ago in Edo, when Him was terrorizing its citizens, a man named Kennai Hiraga, who is modeled after Hiraga Gennai, created the special substance ""Chemical X"". Hiraga poured it on three girls: Momo, Omiya, and Okou. The substance changes their appearance, giving them new hairstyles, now similar to their present day counterparts, and kimono which the bottom portion is shorter than normal, resembling mini skirts, the colors match the Powerpuff Girls Z, and their sashes are black with the symbols of the Powerpuff Girls Z, as well as their own powers and weapons. The three faced and successfully defeated Him, whose weakness to the cold became his undoing. Together with Hiraga, they were able to drain Him's powers and seal his body in a coffin. The Great Edo ChakiChaki Girls can be seen as the heroines who preceded the present day Powerpuff Girls Z and may in fact be their ancestors. Because of his defeat, Him has a deep hatred towards the Great Edo ChakiChaki Girls and directs that hatred towards the Powerpuff Girls Z for their resemblance to them. Similarly to the Steamypuff Girls from the original Powerpuff Girls cartoon, they both stopped a great villain from a previous era.

Typhlosole,"['All articles lacking sources', 'Animal anatomy', 'Articles lacking sources from December 2009']","A typhlosole is an internal fold of the intestine or intestine inner wall.  Typhlosoles occur in bivalve mollusks, lampreys and some annelids and echinoderms.
In earthworms, it is a dorsal flap of the intestine that runs along most of its length, effectively forming a tube within a tube, and increasing the absorption area by that of its inner surface. Its function is to increase intestine surface area for more efficient absorption of digested nutrients. In different earthworm families, the typhlosole appears to have multiple origins.  The Lumbricidae, for example, have a typhlosole which is an infolding of all layers of the intestine wall, whereas in some other families (e.g. Megascolecidae), it is an infolding of only the inner layer, and in many earthworms it is absent.

== Origins ==
The term compact city was first coined in 1973 by George Dantzig and Thomas L. Saaty, two mathematicians whose utopian vision was largely driven by a desire to see more efficient use of resources. The concept, as it has influenced urban planning, is often attributed to Jane Jacobs and her book The Death and Life of Great American Cities (1961), a critique of modernist planning policies claimed by Jacobs to be destroying many existing inner-city communities.
Among other criticisms of the conventional planning and transport planning of the time, Jacobs' work attacked the tendency, inherited from the garden city movement, towards reducing the density of dwellings in urban areas. Four conditions were necessary to enable the diversity essential for urban renewal: mixed uses, small walkable blocks, mingling of building ages and types, and ""a sufficiently dense concentration of people"". The 'sufficient' density would vary according to local circumstances but, in general, a hundred dwellings per acre (247 per hectare – high by American standards, but quite common in European and Asian cities) could be considered a minimum.


== Important terms ==
To understand a discussion about compact cities several key terms need to be defined. The first term is urban density. Urban density refers to how many people live in a square mile of land. It is used as a variable in evaluating how livable a city design is. The optimal urban density for compact cities is high enough to keep residents close to community amenities but low enough to allow residents access to green spaces, reasonable privacy, and acceptable views.Another term associated with the discussion about the compact city commuter is self-sustaining. Self-sustaining means that the city has everything that a person needs within the community. This includes stores, employers, a post office, service providers, energy generation, waste disposal and processing, and small-scale agricultural production (community gardens and/or vertical gardening).
Since the objective of the compact city is to make the community as accessible as possible to residents, the term pedestrian design also needs to be defined. Pedestrian design means that the compact city's layout and features support pedestrian traffic. This is an important part of a compact city design because it facilitates the flow of foot and bike traffic through the community. While a pedestrian design will primarily focus on hardscape elements, such as pathways and sidewalks, green space also is important to consider.
Green space, defined as the areas of nature found in the landscaping of a community, includes grassy patches, flowerbeds, trees, rock gardens, and water features. Green space is important in compact city designs because they enhance the aesthetics of the community. It also helps to control storm runoff, and they help to remove CO2 and other toxins from the air.Proximity is the final term that needs to be defined. It refers to how close a community's amenities are to where people live. Ideally, compact cities will keep key amenities within walking distance of people's homes. The acceptability of proximity to different amenities is calculated based on travel time and distance.


== The compact city and related concepts ==
Although the concept of 'compact city' was coined by American writers, it has been used more in recent years by European and particularly British planners and academics. See, for example, the writings of Michael Jenks.In North America the term 'smart growth' has become increasingly common linked to the concept of 'smart city'. The concept of 'smart growth' is very similar to 'compact city', although 'smart growth' carries more strongly normative connotations, implicitly accepting the emphasis in current mainstream debates that growth is necessary and good. The term is often used loosely to accommodate these debatesCognate concepts include 'sustainable urban development' with no presumption that development equals growth.Another alternative concept is 'green urbanism'. Steffen Lehmann has extensively written about the compact city and green urbanism. His work presents a series of international case studies and outlines 15 core principles for the design of compact, sustainable cities.


== The compact city and proximity ==
Compact cities are intended to provide all one needs to live in one community, including work opportunities. Someone who works in a compact city can walk or bike a short distance to work instead of driving. This reduces fossil fuel consumption and emissions and pollutants, as well as traffic density. This is a main selling point of a compact city. However, not everyone finds work in the city, and consequently many people commute to neighboring cities for work. This has two drawbacks: commuting time and the impact of commuting.
A study by Boussauw et al. found that commute times depend on urban density and the diversity of structures found in the community. The findings show that shorter commutes correlate with high values for density, diversity, and job accessibility. Thus proximity to work within a compact city needs the city to include structures that are appropriate for businesses in different industries; it also depends on the city's density of development. The more developed the city is, therefore, the more employers can be located there, and the fewer employees will need to commute long distances.
Proximity also affects residents' access to green spaces. This is related because the more green space a community has the lower the development's urban density, thus increasing average commuting distance. In a study by Wolsink, participants viewed community proximity to green spaces as important, because green spaces provided recreational and educational opportunities, enhanced mental health, made the city more attractive. These benefits made additional time in commutes acceptable to residents. However, to remain acceptable, the proximity range needed to remain reasonable.


== Compact cities and sustainability ==
Another selling point of compact cities is that they are supposed to be sustainable developments. However, recent studies suggest that these developments are not as green as promised. For example, in the study by Rérat, the author discussed three criticisms of the compact city model. The first criticism was that supply and demand alignments are not feasible in some cases. What this means is that there are limits to how many people can fit into a space because of resource and design limitations. Additionally, while a high-density may be achievable, it likely will counter the demands and expectations of residents who want more privacy and more personal space. The second criticism of the compact city is that to produce highly desirable living conditions and a high quality of life, the cost of living needs to increase. Consequently, integrating desirable traits into compact cities makes the living spaces expensive, pricing out lower-income families and pushing them to the outskirts of town. This stimulates urban sprawl and places the burden of longer commutes on low-income workers, further expanding disparities in wealth and quality of life. The third criticism of the compact city is that its environmental impacts are significant. Dense populations mean waste and pollution are also dense. This concentrates the impact of communities and necessitates expensive control mechanism.
Rérat is not the only researcher showing evidence that compact cities are not as sustainable as promised. The work by Westernick et al. also show that there are sustainability trade-offs found within compact city designs. Westernick et al. compared compact cities to dispersed cities to see where sustainability factors differed. The findings showed that compact cities excelled in efficient land consumption, more flexible land use patterns, cost efficiency of development and maintenance, and reduced reliance on fossil fuels and motor vehicles. In contrast, however, the sustainability disadvantages included higher vulnerability to disaster impacts, less personal space, less green space where people live, and higher environmental impact because of density. These drawbacks make compact cities less sustainable and justify the need for design improvements.


== The compact city, urban sprawl and automobile dependency ==
Whether the compact city (or 'smart growth') does or can reduce problems of automobile dependency associated with urban sprawl has been fiercely contested over several decades. An influential study in 1989 by Peter Newman and Jeff Kenworthy compared 32 cities across North America, Australia, Europe and Asia. The study's methodology has been criticised but the main finding that denser cities, particularly in Asia, have lower car use than sprawling cities, particularly in North America, has been largely accepted – although the relationship is clearer at the extremes across continents than it is within countries where conditions are more similar.
Within cities, studies from across many countries (mainly in the developed world) have shown that denser urban areas with greater mixture of land use and better public transport tend to have lower car use than less dense suburban and exurban residential areas. This usually holds true even after controlling for socio-economic factors such as differences in household composition and income. This does not necessarily imply that suburban sprawl causes high car use, however. One confounding factor, which has been the subject of many studies, is residential self-selection: people who prefer to drive tend to move towards low density suburbs, whereas people who prefer to walk, cycle or use transit tend to move towards higher density urban areas, better served by public transport. Some studies have found that, when self-selection is controlled for, the built environment has no significant effect on travel behaviour. More recent studies using more sophisticated methodologies have generally refuted these findings: density, land use and public transport accessibility can influence travel behaviour, although social and economic factors, particularly household income, usually exert a stronger influence.


== The paradox of intensification ==
Reviewing the evidence on urban intensification, smart growth and their effects on travel behaviour, Melia et al. (2011) found support for the arguments of both supporters and opponents of the compact city. Planning policies which increase population densities in urban areas do tend to reduce car use, but the effect is a weak one, so doubling the population density of a particular area will not halve the frequency or distance of car use.
For example, Portland, Oregon, a U.S. city which has pursued smart growth policies, substantially increased its population density between 1990 and 2000 when other US cities of a similar size were reducing in density. As predicted by the paradox, traffic volumes and congestion both increased more rapidly than in the other cities, despite a substantial increase in transit use.These findings led them to propose the paradox of intensification, which states:

Ceteris paribus, urban intensification which increases population density will reduce per capita car use, with benefits to the global environment, but will also increase concentrations of motor traffic, worsening the local environment in those locations where it occurs.
At the citywide level it may be possible, through a range of positive measures, to counteract the increases in traffic and congestion which would otherwise result from increasing population densities: Freiburg im Breisgau in Germany is one example of a city which has been more successful in this respect.
This study also reviewed evidence on the local effects of building at higher densities. At the level of the neighbourhood or individual development, positive measures (e.g. improvements to public transport) will usually be insufficient to counteract the traffic effect of increasing population density. This leaves policy-makers with four choices: intensify and accept the local consequences, sprawl and accept the wider consequences, a compromise with some element of both, or intensify accompanied by more radical measures such as parking restrictions, closing roads to traffic and carfree zones.
Building on self-reports of a sample of 336 residents who have often experienced a shift from low to high density living in Tehran, Ziafati Bafarasat (2017) tests a hypothesis suggesting that, in the context of attempts to escape and restore from chronic noise, contact load, and the sense of encapsulation, a compact city might increase discretionary car travel. Findings support the hypothesis as these density stressors increased the car travel time of 30–48% of respondents by at least 7–24% for escape and restoration. This appears to offset the trip-reduction benefit of higher density living. If a 5% reduction is assumed in car travel distance in the sample districts in the context of density, and, under the optimistic scenario, that the time-distance ratio is 1 in high density areas, this finding feeds into the conclusion that high density might have had no positive effect on, or even increased to a limited degree, the overall time of car travel.


== Case studies ==
Around the globe, countries experiment with compact city models. To understand the outcomes of these model cities, the following discussion explores two case studies. The first case study comes from Australia and the second comes from Belgium.
The Australian case of compact cities derives from a study by Bunker. It provides a commentary on urban development strategies used in Australia. To begin with, Australia has very low population density because of its extensive availability of space and its relatively low population. However, beginning in 2000, Australia adopted the compact city model for all its urban planning. Planners adopted this development philosophy because projections showed that the growth in Australia's largest cities was expected to be high over the next decade. In adopting the compact city model, Australian planners set their development objectives to limit urban sprawl; to promote infill, renewal, and redevelopment; to increase dwelling type diversity; to diversify economic activity in communities; to motivate development to remain close to the economic diversity; to encourage residents to use public transportation; and to inspire residents to walk or cycle instead of driving cars (13). Since 2000, Australia's growth patterns have followed these objectives with positive outcomes. Not only are fossil fuel reduction objectives being met, but compact community members are adopting more active lifestyles, enhancing public health. This suggests that by planning to make urban communities self-sustaining, compact city planners can meet their objectives.
The Belgium case came from an article by Boussauw et al. This article compared two different development models used in Belgium. The models were the New Urbanism model and the Compact City model. Both models promote dense populations with lots of open green spaces and proximity to shopping and work options. The findings showed that the closer the proximity is within a community, the more likely people are to walk or cycle instead of driving. This shows that compact city models can produce environmental and public health benefits if proximity is optimized and if planners integrate pedestrian designs into the compact city layout. However, what the study did not address were the other factors that impact the environment's health, such as waste production and management, pollution density, and human impact on the environment.


== Improvements to be made ==
The compact city model has been shown to be a good model, but everything can use improvement. Some ideas for possible improvements include vertical green spaces, living walls and roofs, and the development of sustainable systems. To understand why these suggestions are a good idea, the following descriptions provide a quick overview of each.
Vertical gardens are planting installations placed on the exterior walls of buildings. This innovation is highly cost-effective and offers multiple benefits to community members. For example, these installations not only add greenery to urban landscapes, but they also provide insulation to the building, can act as natural air conditioners, and remove CO2 from the air.Living roofs are like vertical gardens in that they are greenscapes added to the exterior of a building. However, where they differ is that living roofs utilize the horizontal space on the roof for gardens. These rooftop gardens provide insulation on the roof, help to manage runoff, and help to scrub CO2 from the air. An added benefit of this innovation is that it can produce healthy food for the building's residents.
Another innovation compact cities need to adopt are sustainable systems. Sustainable systems create the infrastructure to naturally process sewage waste, grey water, and storm runoff on-site. These systems channel the waste products through a filtration system that not only prevents flooding on the community's hardscape, but that also utilizes wastewater to fertilize and water gardens. As the plants filter the waste water, they remove solid particles, cleaning it before it joins ground or surface water.


== Influence in Europe ==
The European Commission published the Green Paper Towards a new culture for urban mobility on 27 September 2007. Several institutions reacted to the Green Paper among them the European Parliament.
Based on the preparatory work of its Committee on Transport and Tourism, the European Parliament in its Resolution of 9 July 2008 called among other things for “drawing up customised sustainable mobility plans and supporting measures for regional and urban planning ('city of short distances'), a process in which all parties concerned should be involved from an early stage”. They referred among others to the EU strategy to combat climate change and other environmental problems.


=== Influence in the Netherlands ===
The Netherlands' urban planning is highly influenced by the 'compacte stad'. In the 1960s cities expanded in large, top-down planned neighbourhoods using the scarce space available to use as efficiently as possible. Later, cities were not allowed to expand anyhow, giving way for completely new towns on moderate distances from the main city, in order to keep the new towns influenced mainly by their 'capital', however, giving the towns also some own air. Public transport between the main city and its towns in the rural areas connected them. This policy (groeikernenbeleid) resulted in typical commuter towns. Afterwards, in the 1980s, governments decided people need and want to live in this capital city itself and the groeikernenbeleid was rejected. New urban neighbourhoods had to be around a city, as a skin, encircling skins of older neighbourhoods. The new neighbourhoods were cleverly designed, relatively dense and with very good connections to get downtown by public transport or bicycle.
This history results in a lack of urban sprawl, or at least of new urban sprawl. As new neighbourhoods need to be built as an outer skin around existing settlements and as other policies prohibited establishing new settlements outside other towns or villages, no new linear villages could be founded without governmental intervention any more. This in order to keep the rural landscape 'clean' and cities dense and compact.
As a result, all neighbourhoods in Dutch towns are close to city centres, enabling inhabitants to get around quickly and cheaply by bike. Getting out of town doesn't involve driving through ever-ongoing sprawled suburbs, making it easy and popular to visit rural areas. By all these regulations, for instance the Groene Hart (Green Heart amid the Randstad) is kept green, while buffers around cities like Amsterdam, Utrecht and Delft avoids getting the cities grown together entirely.


=== Influence in the United Kingdom ===
The compact city had a particularly strong influence on planning policy in the UK during the Labour Governments of 1997–2010. The first Labour Government in 1998 set up the Urban Taskforce under Lord Rogers of Riverside, which produced the report Towards an Urban Renaissance. Influenced by this report, the UK Government issued PPG 3 Planning Policy Guidance on Housing which introduced a 60% brownfield target, a minimum net residential density guideline of 30 dwellings per hectare, a sequential hierarchy beginning with urban brownfield land, maximum parking guidelines replacing the previous minima, and a policy of intensification around public transport nodes. Over the succeeding years, these targets were substantially exceeded, with the brownfield proportion reaching 80% by 2009, and average densities 43 dwellings per hectare.


== In Russia and other ex-Soviet countries ==
Most cities in Russia such as regional capitals Yaroslavl, Krasnodar, Novosibirsk, etc., as well as cities and towns in other ex Eastern Bloc countries, such as Trencin or Zvolen in Slovakia, can be qualified as compact cities, where most people live in residential areas made up of big apartment blocks between 3 and 8 floors, in parks full of trees, flowers, playgrounds, benches, etc. with small shops and cafés on the ground level or in clusters around the main paths. Residents have thus much space to socialize. Cars typically have only limited access to the “inner garden ” that surrounds the apartment blocks and are limited to the main boulevards. The high population density means people have to walk smaller distances to get to the supermarket, school, kindergarten, pub, restaurant, grocery, library, gym, or access the public transportation system – a mix of public buses and tramway and private minibuses. Most people in those cities do not own a car and if they do, they use it only in the summer to drive to their dacha. Living in apartments also means fewer losses of energy spent on heating, each apartment block having one central heating system in the basement that can be either publicly or privately run.


== Conclusion ==
Compact cities are designed to keep residents in close proximity to everything they need for daily living, including shopping, education, housing, and work. The rationale of this urban development model is to reduce the amount of time people spend commuting, as well as to reduce fossil fuel usage and to increase the sustainability of developments. While compact cities promise short commutes and sustainable designs, these benefits are not guaranteed. The problems preventing the desired outcomes include failure to consider the concentrated impact of dense populations on the environment and lack of planning for green space and pollution control. If planning addresses these issues and innovates to solve problems, everything promised by compact cities can be delivered.

Malpass sits on the boards of UBS Funds, the New Mountain Financial Corporation, and the Gary Klinsky Children's Center. He is also a former director of the National Committee on United States–China Relations, the Council of the Americas, and the Economic Club of New York, and a former member of the board of trustees of the Manhattan Institute.


=== Economic forecasts ===
Malpass has been noted for his forecasts before the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and in the time period following the Great Recession. In 2007, before the housing market collapse, Malpass wrote for The Wall Street Journal that ""Housing and debt markets are not that big a part of the U.S. economy, or of job creation...the housing- and debt-market corrections will probably add to the length of the U.S. economic expansion."" He also called for the raising of interest rates in 2011 at a time when others believed this would be harmful to the economy. Bruce Bartlett cited Malpass's 2008 forecast of economic growth and his 2012 forecast of recession as specific examples of partisan bias in economic forecasts.


=== Trump advisor ===
Malpass joined Donald Trump's presidential campaign in May 2016 as Senior Economic Advisor. He appeared frequently on television and radio to support Trump's message of faster growth through policy reforms. Four of his pre-election Forbes columns discussed the need for political upheaval to upend the status quo. On August 5, the campaign announced an economic round-table including Malpass. His September 1, 2016, The New York Times op-ed essay described fast growth through a policy upheaval covering taxes, trade, regulations and energy (""Why Our Economy Needs Trump""). Throughout the election time period, Malpass was heading the transition team's work on economic agencies including Treasury, Commerce, the Federal Reserve, USTR and independent regulatory agencies as Trump prepared to become president.


=== Under Secretary of the Treasury ===

In March 2017, the White House announced that Malpass would be President Trump's nominee for Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs. Malpass was confirmed for the position by the United States Senate on August 3, 2017.Malpass took a critical position on China during his tenure. He was described as ""a champion of President Donald Trump's protectionist message.""


=== World Bank President ===
In February 2019, President Trump announced Malpass as the nominee for President of the World Bank, succeeding Jim Yong Kim, who had announced in January 2019 that he would be stepping down three years prior to the end of his five-year term in 2022. Malpass was unanimously approved by the executive board on April 5, 2019, and began his term on April 9.


== Personal life ==
Malpass and his wife, Adele, daughter of Herman Obermayer and granddaughter of Neville Levy, live in New York City. Adele Malpass was appointed as the Chairwoman of the Manhattan Republican Party in January 2015 and was elected to a two-year term in September 2015. She was succeeded in the role by Andrea Catsimatidis, daughter of billionaire businessman John Catsimatidis, after resigning to move to Washington when Malpass was appointed to his role in the Treasury Department under President Trump. Malpass is a native of northern Michigan.

Gas leaks can be hazardous to health as well as the environment. Even a small leak into a building or other confined space may gradually build up an explosive or lethal concentration of gas.  Leaks of natural gas and refrigerant gas into the atmosphere are especially harmful due to their global warming potential and ozone depletion potential.Leaks of gases associated with industrial operations and equipment are also generally known as fugitive emissions.

== Fire and explosion safety ==
Pure natural gas is colorless and odorless, and is composed primarily of methane. Unpleasant scents in the form of traces of mercaptans are usually added, to assist in identifying leaks. This odor may be perceived as rotting eggs, or a faintly unpleasant skunk smell. Persons detecting the odor must evacuate the area and abstain from using open flames or operating electrical equipment, to reduce the risk of fire and explosion.
As a result of the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 passed in the United States, federal safety standards require companies providing natural gas to conduct safety inspections for gas leaks in homes and other buildings receiving natural gas.  The gas company is required to inspect gas meters and inside gas piping from the point of entry into the building to the outlet side of the gas meter for gas leaks.  This may require entry into private homes by the natural gas companies to check for hazardous conditions.


== Harm to vegetation ==
Gas leaks can damage or kill plants.  In addition to leaks from natural gas pipes, methane and other gases migrating from landfill garbage disposal sites can also cause chlorosis and necrosis in grass, weeds, or trees. In some cases, leaking gas may migrate as far as 100 feet (30 m) from the source of the leak to an affected tree.


== Harm to animals ==
Methane is an asphyxiant gas which can reduce the normal oxygen concentration in breathing air.  Small animals and birds are also more sensitive to toxic gas like carbon monoxide that are sometimes present with natural gas.  The expression ""canary in a coal mine"" derives from the historical practice of using a canary as an animal sentinel to detect dangerously high concentrations of naturally occurring coal gas.


== Greenhouse gas emissions ==
Methane, the primary constituent of natural gas, is up to 120 times as potent a greenhouse gas as carbon dioxide.  Thus, the release of unburned natural gas produces much stronger effects than the carbon dioxide that would have been released if the gas had been burned as intended.


== Leak grades ==
In the United States, most state and federal agencies have adopted the Gas Piping and Technology Committee (GPTC) standards for grading natural gas leaks.
A Grade 1 leak is a leak that represents an existing or probable hazard to persons or property, and requires immediate repair or continuous action until the conditions are no longer hazardous.
Examples of a Grade 1 leak are:

Any leak which, in the judgment of operating personnel at the scene, is regarded as an immediate hazard.
Escaping gas that has ignited.
Any indication of gas which has migrated into or under a building, or into a tunnel.
Any reading at the outside wall of a building, or where gas would likely migrate to an outside wall of a building.
Any reading of 80% LEL, or greater, in a confined space.
Any reading of 80% LEL, or greater in small substructures (other than gas associated sub structures) from which gas would likely migrate to the outside wall of a building.
Any leak that can be seen, heard, or felt, and which is in a location that may endanger the general public or property.A Grade 2 leak is a leak that is recognized as being non-hazardous at the time of detection, but justifies scheduled repair based on probable future hazard.
Examples of a Grade 2 Leak are:

Leaks Requiring Action Ahead of Ground Freezing or Other Adverse Changes in Venting Conditions. Any leak which, under frozen or other adverse soil conditions, would likely migrate to the outside wall of a building.
Leaks requiring action within six months
Any reading of 40% LEL, or greater, under a sidewalk in a wall-to-wall paved area that does not qualify as a Grade 1 leak.
Any reading of 100% LEL, or greater, under a street in a wall-to-wall paved area that has significant gas migration and does not qualify as a Grade 1 leak.
Any reading less than 80% LEL in small substructures (other than gas associated substructures) from which gas would likely migrate creating a probable future hazard.
Any reading between 20% LEL and 80% LEL in a confined space.
Any reading on a pipeline operating at 30 percent specified minimum yield strength (SMYS) or greater, in a class 3 or 4 location, which does not qualify as a Grade 1 leak.
Any reading of 80% LEL, or greater, in gas associated sub-structures.
Any leak which, in the judgment of operating personnel at the scene, is of sufficient magnitude to justify scheduled repair.A Grade 3 leak is non-hazardous at the time of detection and can be reasonably expected to remain non-hazardous.
Examples of a Grade 3 Leak are:

Any reading of less than 80% LEL in small gas associated substructures.
Any reading under a street in areas without wall-to-wall paving where it is unlikely the gas could migrate to the out-side wall of a building.
Any reading of less than 20% LEL in a confined space.


== Studies ==
In 2012, Boston University professor Nathan Phillips and his students drove along all 785 miles (1,263 km) of Boston roads with a gas sensor, identifying 3300 leaks.  The Conservation Law Foundation produced a map showing around 4000 leaks reported to the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities. In July 2014, the Environmental Defense Fund released an interactive online map based on gas sensors attached to three  mapping cars which already were being driven along Boston streets to update Google Earth Street View.  This survey differed from the previous studies in that an estimate of leak severity was produced, rather than just leak detection.  This map should help the gas utility to prioritize leak repairs, as well as raising public awareness of the problem.In 2017, Rhode Island released an estimated 15.7 million metric tons of greenhouse gases, about a third of which comes from leaks in natural gas pipes. This figure, published in 2019, was calculated based on an assumed leakage rate of 2.7% (as that is the rate of leakage in the nearby city of Boston). The study's authors estimated that fixing the leaks would incur an annual cost of $1.6 billion to $4 billion.


== Regulation ==


=== Massachusetts ===
Legislation passed in 2014 requires gas suppliers to make greater efforts to control some of the 20,000 documented leaks in the US state of Massachusetts.  The new law requires grade 1 and 2 leaks to be repaired if the street above a gas pipe is dug up, and requires priority be given to leaks near schools.  It provides a mechanism for increased revenue from ratepayers (up to 1.5% without further approval) to cover the cost of repairs and replacement of leak-prone materials (like cast iron and non-cathodically protected steel) on an accelerated basis.  The law sets a target of 20 years for replacement of pipes made from leak-prone materials if feasible given the revenue cap; as of 2015, Columbia Gas of Massachusetts (formerly named ""Bay State Gas""), Berkshire Gas, Liberty Utilities, National Grid, and Unitil say they will meet this target, but NSTAR says it will take 25 years to complete.  Leaks, statistics on leak-prone materials, and financial statements are reported annually to the Department of Public Utilities, which also has responsibility for rate-setting.
Additional proposals not included in the law would have required grade 3 leaks to be repaired during road construction, and priority for leaks which are killing trees or which were near hospitals or churches.An attorney for the Conservation Law Foundation stated that the leaks were worth $38.8 million in lost natural gas, which also contributes 4% of the state's greenhouse gas emissions. A federal study prompted by US Senator Edward J. Markey concluded that Massachusetts consumers paid approximately $1.5 billion from 2000–2011 for gas which leaked and benefited no one. Markey has also backed legislation that would implement similar requirements at the national level, along with financing provisions for repairs.


== History ==
Catastrophic gas leaks, such as the Bhopal disaster are well-recognized as problems, but the more-subtle effects of chronic low-level leaks have been slower to gain recognition.


== Other contexts ==
In work with dangerous gases (such as in a lab or industrial setting), a gas leak may require hazmat emergency response, especially if the leaked material is flammable, explosive, corrosive, or toxic.

== Function ==
The ventromedial nucleus (VMN) is most commonly associated with satiety. Early studies showed that VMN lesions caused over-eating and obesity in rats. However, the interpretation of these experiments was summarily discredited when Gold's research demonstrated that precision lesioning of the VMN did not result in hyperphagia. Nevertheless, numerous studies have shown that the immediacy of hyperphagia and obesity syndrome are a consequence of VMN lesions or procaine injections, and point to the VMN's role in satiety. A major review of the subject in 2006 concluded that, ""anatomical studies done both before and after Gold's study did not replicate his results with lesions, and in nearly every published direct comparison of VMH lesions vs. PVN or VNAB lesions, the group with VMH lesions ate substantially more food and gained twice as much weight."" This strongly substantiates the classification of VMN as the primary satiety center in the hypothalamus.
It has also been found that lesions to the VMH in rats caused increased plasma insulin levels. Rats with a VMH lesion compared to normal rats overproduce a circulating satiety factor, to which the control rats can respond and rats with a VMH lesion cannot respond.  A lesion to the VMH makes rats overproduce leptin, which they cannot respond to causing them to over eat, leading to obesity.Researchers looked at a series of twenty-one animals of various degrees of adiposity, with respect to growth appearance, fat distribution, general physical condition, and the correlation between the level of adiposity attained and the correlation of the hypothalamic lesion. Lesions in the hypothalamic area, particularly the region of the ventromedial hypothalamus interrupts a large number of the descending fibers from the hypothalamic cell groups that were found to contribute to obesity in rats.Another study found that there seems to be a higher concentration of cannabinoid receptor mRNA within the VMH in comparison to other nuclei within the hypothalamus. The cannabinoid ingestion has been linked to rewarding processes, and also with the release of dopamine in the brain.VMH is also important in mammal play behaviour. Lesions to VMH along with the hippocampus, amygdala, the cerebellum, and the lateral hypothalamus are all linked to reduced play.The VMHdm has a role in the male vocalizations and scent marking behaviors.The VMHvl contains many distinct neuronal populations that contribute to varying, often distinct, functions. Notably, this region plays a role in sexual behaviors in females (lordosis), thus stimulating their sexual arousal. The VMHvl has also been found to play a role in estrogen-mediated movement  and energy expenditure/thermogenesis.Bilateral FOS expression in the VMH after repeated seizures is associated with alteration in the severity of flurothyl induced seizures in C57BL/6J mice that are not present in DBA/2J mice. Moreover, bilateral lesions of the VMH are able to block the propagation of seizure discharge to enter the brainstem seizure system.

== The ""Dhimma contract"" ==
Based on Quranic verses and Islamic traditions, sharia law distinguishes between Muslims, followers of other Abrahamic religions, and Pagans or people belonging to other polytheistic religions. As monotheists, Jews and Christians have traditionally been considered ""People of the Book"", and afforded a special legal status known as dhimmi derived from a theoretical contract—""dhimma"" or ""residence in return for taxes"". Islamic legal systems based on sharia law incorporated the religious laws and courts of Christians, Jews, and Hindus, as seen in the early caliphate, al-Andalus, Indian subcontinent, and the Ottoman Millet system.In Yemenite Jewish sources, a treaty was drafted between Muhammad and his Jewish subjects, known as kitāb ḏimmat al-nabi, written in the 17th year of the Hijra (638 CE), which gave express liberty to the Jews living in Arabia to observe the Sabbath and to grow-out their side-locks, but required them to pay the jizya (poll-tax) annually for their protection. Muslim governments in the Indus basin readily extended the dhimmi status to the Hindus and Buddhists of India. Eventually, the largest school of Islamic jurisprudence applied this term to all Non-Muslims living in Muslim lands outside the sacred area surrounding Mecca, Arabia.In medieval Islamic societies, the qadi (Islamic judge) usually could not interfere in the matters of non-Muslims unless the parties voluntarily chose to be judged according to Islamic law, thus the dhimmi communities living in Islamic states usually had their own laws independent from the sharia law, as with the Jews who would have their own rabbinical courts. These courts did not cover cases that involved other religious groups, or capital offences or threats to public order. By the 18th century, however, dhimmi frequently attended the Ottoman Muslim courts, where cases were taken against them by Muslims, or they took cases against Muslims or other dhimmi. Oaths sworn by dhimmi in these courts were tailored to their beliefs. Non-Muslims were allowed to engage in certain practices (such as the consumption of alcohol and pork) that were usually forbidden by Islamic law, in point of fact, any Muslim who pours away their wine or forcibly appropriates it is liable to pay compensation. Some Islamic theologians held that Zoroastrian ""self-marriages"", considered incestuous under sharia, should also be tolerated. Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya (1292–1350) opined that most scholars of the Hanbali school held that non-Muslims were entitled to such practices, as long as they were not presented to sharia courts and the religious minorities in question held them to be permissible. This ruling was based on the precedent that there were no records of the Islamic prophet Muhammad forbidding such self-marriages among Zoroastrians, despite coming into contact with Zoroastrians and knowing about this practice. Religious minorities were also free to do as they wished in their own homes, provided they did not publicly engage in illicit sexual activity in ways that could threaten public morals.There are parallels for this in Roman and Jewish law. According to law professor H. Patrick Glenn of McGill University, ""[t]oday it is said that the dhimmi are 'excluded from the specifically Muslim privileges, but on the other hand they are excluded from the specifically Muslim duties' while (and here there are clear parallels with western public and private law treatment of aliens—Fremdenrecht, la condition de estrangers), '[f]or the rest, the Muslim and the dhimmi are equal in practically the whole of the law of property and of contracts and obligations'."" Quoting the Qur'anic statement, ""Let Christians judge according to what We have revealed in the Gospel"", Muhammad Hamidullah writes that Islam decentralized and ""communalized"" law and justice. However, the classical dhimma contract is no longer enforced. Western influence over the Muslim world has been instrumental in eliminating the restrictions and protections of the dhimma contract.


=== The Dhimma contract and Sharia law ===

The dhimma contract is an integral part of traditional Islamic sharia law. From the 9th century AD, the power to interpret and refine law in traditional Islamic societies was in the hands of the scholars (ulama). This separation of powers served to limit the range of actions available to the ruler, who could not easily decree or reinterpret law independently and expect the continued support of the community. Through succeeding centuries and empires, the balance between the ulema and the rulers shifted and reformed, but the balance of power was never decisively changed. At the beginning of the 19th century, the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution introduced an era of European world hegemony that included the domination of most of the Muslim lands. At the end of the Second World War, the European powers found themselves too weakened to maintain their empires. The wide variety in forms of government, systems of law, attitudes toward modernity and interpretations of sharia are a result of the ensuing drives for independence and modernity in the Muslim world.Muslim states, sects, schools of thought and individuals differ as to exactly what sharia law entails. In addition, Muslim states today utilize a spectrum of legal systems. Most states have a mixed system that implements certain aspects of sharia while acknowledging the supremacy of a constitution. A few, such as Turkey, have declared themselves secular. Local and customary laws may take precedence in certain matters, as well. Islamic law is therefore polynormative, and despite several cases of regression in recent years, the trend is towards liberalization. Questions of human rights and the status of minorities cannot be generalized with regards to the Muslim world. They must instead be examined on a case-by-case basis, within specific political and cultural contexts, using perspectives drawn from the historical framework.


=== The end of the Dhimma contract ===
The status of the dhimmi ""was for long accepted with resignation by the Christians and with gratitude by the Jews"" but the rising power of Christendom and the radical ideas of the French Revolution caused a wave of discontent among Christian dhimmis. The continuing and growing pressure from the European powers combined with pressure from Muslim reformers gradually relaxed the inequalities between Muslims and non-Muslims.On 18 February 1856, the Ottoman Reform Edict of 1856 (Hatt-i Humayan) was issued, building upon the 1839 edict. It came about partly as a result of pressure from and the efforts of the ambassadors of France, Austria and the United Kingdom, whose respective countries were needed as allies in the Crimean War. It again proclaimed the principle of equality between Muslims and non-Muslims, and produced many specific reforms to this end. For example, the jizya tax was abolished and non-Muslims were allowed to join the army.


=== Views of modern Islamic scholars on the status of non-Muslims in an Islamic society ===
The Iranian Shi'a Muslim Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini indicates in his book Islamic Government: Governance of the Jurist that non-Muslims should be required to pay the poll tax, in return for which they would profit from the protection and services of the state; they would, however, be excluded from all participation in the political process. Bernard Lewis remarks about Khomeini that one of his main grievances against the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was that his legislation allowed the theoretical possibility of non-Muslims exercising political or judicial authority over Muslims.
The Egyptian theologian Yusuf al-Qaradawi, chairman of the International Union of Muslim Scholars, has stated in his Al Jazeera program Sharia and Life, which has an estimated audience of 35 to 60 million viewers: ""When we say dhimmis (ahl al-dhimma) it means that [...] they are under the covenant of God and His Messenger and the Muslim community and their responsibility (ḍamān), and it is everyone's duty to protect them, and this is what is intended by the word. At present many of our brethren are offended by the word dhimmis, and I have stated in what I wrote in my books that I don't see anything to prevent contemporary Islamic ijtihad from discarding this word dhimmis and calling them non-Muslim citizens.""
Another Egyptian Islamist, Mohammad Salim al-Awa argued the concept of dhimmi must be re-interpreted in the context of Egyptian nationalism. Al-Awa and other Muslim scholars based this on the idea that while the previous dhimma condition result from the Islamic conquest, the modern Egyptian state results from a joint Muslim-Christian campaign to end the British occupation of Egypt. In modern-day Egypt, he argues, the constitution replaces the dhimma contract.
Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i, a 20th-century Shia scholar writes that dhimmis should be treated ""in a good and decent manner"". He addresses the argument that good treatment of dhimmis was abrogated by Quranic verse 9:29 by stating that, in the literal sense, this verse is not in conflict with good treatment of dhimmis.
Javed Ahmad Ghamidi, a Pakistani theologian, writes in Mizan that certain directives of the Quran were specific only to Muhammad against peoples of his times, besides other directives, the campaign involved asking the polytheists of Arabia for submission to Islam as a condition for exoneration and the others for jizya and submission to the political authority of the Muslims for exemption from capital punishment and for military protection as the dhimmis of the Muslims. Therefore, after Muhammad and his companions, there is no concept in Islam obliging Muslims to wage war for propagation or implementation of Islam.
The Iranian Shia jurist Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi states in Selection of the Tafsir Nemooneh that the main philosophy of jizya is that it is only a financial aid to those Muslims who are in the charge of safeguarding the security of the state and dhimmis' lives and properties on their behalf.
Prominent Islamic thinkers like Fahmi Huwaidi and Tarek El-Bishry have based their justification for full citizenship of non-Muslims in an Islamic states on the precedent set by Muhammad in the Constitution of Medina. They argue that in this charter the People of Book, have the status of citizens (muwatinun) rather than dhimmis, sharing equal rights and duties with Muslims.
Legal scholar L. Ali Khan also points to the Constitution of Medina as a way forward for Islamic states in his 2006 paper titled The Medina Constitution. He suggests this ancient document, which governed the status of religions and races in the first Islamic state, in which Jewish tribes are ""placed on an equal footing with [...] Muslims"" and granted ""the freedom of religion,"" can serve as a basis for the protection of minority rights, equality, and religious freedom in the modern Islamic state.
Tariq Ramadan, Professor of Islamic Studies at the University of Oxford, advocates the inclusion of academic disciplines and Islamic society, along with traditional Islamic scholars, in an effort to reform Islamic law and address modern conditions. He speaks of remaining faithful to the higher objectives of sharia law. He posits universal rights of dignity, welfare, freedom, equality and justice in a religiously and culturally pluralistic Islamic (or other) society, and proposes a dialogue regarding the modern term ""citizenship,"" although it has no clear precedent in classical fiqh. He further includes the terms ""non-citizen"", ""foreigner"", ""resident"" and ""immigrant"" in this dialogue, and challenges not only Islam, but modern civilization as a whole, to come to terms with these concepts in a meaningful way with regards to problems of racism, discrimination and oppression.


== Dhimmi communities ==
Jews and Christians living under early Muslim rule were considered dhimmis, a status that was later also extended to other non-Muslims like Hindus and Buddhists. They were allowed to ""freely practice their religion, and to enjoy a large measure of communal autonomy"" and guaranteed their personal safety and security of property, in return for paying tribute and acknowledging Muslim rule. Islamic law and custom prohibited the enslavement of free dhimmis within lands under Islamic rule. Taxation from the perspective of dhimmis who came under the Muslim rule, was ""a concrete continuation of the taxes paid to earlier regimes"" (but much lower under the Muslim rule). They were also exempted from the zakat tax paid by Muslims. The dhimmi communities living in Islamic states had their own laws independent from the Sharia law, such as the Jews who had their own Halakhic courts. The dhimmi communities had their own leaders, courts, personal and religious laws, and ""generally speaking, Muslim tolerance of unbelievers was far better than anything available in Christendom, until the rise of secularism in the 17th century"". ""Muslims guaranteed freedom of worship and livelihood, provided that they remained loyal to the Muslim state and paid a poll tax"". ""Muslim governments appointed Christian and Jewish professionals to their bureaucracies"", and thus, Christians and Jews ""contributed to the making of the Islamic civilization"".However, dhimmis faced social and symbolic restrictions, and a pattern of stricter, then more lax, enforcement developed over time. Marshall Hodgson, a historian of Islam, writes that during the era of the High Caliphate (7th–13th Centuries), zealous Shariah-minded Muslims gladly elaborated their code of symbolic restrictions on the dhimmis.From an Islamic legal perspective, the pledge of protection granted dhimmis the freedom to practice their religion and spared them forced conversions. The dhimmis also served a variety of useful purposes, mostly economic, which was another point of concern to jurists. Religious minorities were free to do whatever they wished in their own homes, but could not ""publicly engage in illicit sex in ways that threaten public morals"". In some cases, religious practices that Muslims found repugnant were allowed. One example was the Zoroastrian practice of incestuous ""self-marriage"" where a man could marry his mother, sister or daughter. According to the famous Islamic legal scholar Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya (1292–1350), non-Muslims had the right to engage in such religious practices even if it offended Muslims, under the conditions that such cases not be presented to Islamic Sharia courts and that these religious minorities believed that the practice in question is permissible according to their religion. This ruling was based on the precedent that Muhammad did not forbid such self-marriages among Zoroastrians despite coming in contact with them and having knowledge of their practices.The Arabs generally established garrisons outside towns in the conquered territories, and had little interaction with the local dhimmi populations for purposes other than the collection of taxes. The conquered Christian, Jewish, Mazdean and Buddhist communities were otherwise left to lead their lives as before.


=== Christians ===
According to historians Lewis and Stillman, local Christians in Syria, Iraq, and Egypt were non-Chalcedonians and many may have felt better off under early Muslim rule than under that of the Byzantine Orthodox of Constantinople. In 1095, Pope Urban II urged western European Christians to come to the aid of the Christians of Palestine. The subsequent Crusades brought Roman Catholic Christians into contact with Orthodox Christians whose beliefs they discovered to differ from their own perhaps more than they had realized, and whose position under the rule of the Muslim Fatimid Caliphate was less uncomfortable than had been supposed. Consequently, the Eastern Christians provided perhaps less support to the Crusaders than had been expected. When the Arab East came under Ottoman rule in the 16th century, Christian populations and fortunes rebounded significantly. The Ottomans had long experience dealing with Christian and Jewish minorities, and were more tolerant towards religious minorities than the former Muslim rulers, the Mamluks of Egypt.However, Christians living under Islamic rule have suffered certain legal disadvantages and at times persecution. In the Ottoman Empire, in accordance with the dhimmi system implemented in Muslim countries, they, like all other Christians and also Jews, were accorded certain freedoms. The dhimmi system in the Ottoman Empire was largely based upon the Pact of Umar. The client status established the rights of the non-Muslims to property, livelihood and freedom of worship but they were in essence treated as second-class citizens in the empire and referred to in Turkish as gavours, a pejorative word meaning ""infidel"" or ""unbeliever"". The clause of the Pact of Umar which prohibited non-Muslims from building new places of worship was historically imposed on some communities of the Ottoman Empire and ignored in other cases, at discretion of the local authorities. Although there were no laws mandating religious ghettos, this led to non-Muslim communities being clustered around existing houses of worship.In addition to other legal limitations, Christians were not considered equals to Muslims and several prohibitions were placed on them. Their testimony against Muslims by Christians and Jews was inadmissible in courts of law wherein a Muslim could be punished; this meant that their testimony could only be considered in commercial cases. They were forbidden to carry weapons or ride atop horses and camels. Their houses could not overlook those of Muslims; and their religious practices were severely circumscribed (e.g., the ringing of church bells was strictly forbidden).


=== Jews ===
Because the early Islamic conquests initially preserved much of the existing administrative machinery and culture, in many territories they amounted to little more than a change of rulers for the subject populations, which ""brought peace to peoples demoralized and disaffected by the casualties and heavy taxation that resulted from the years of Byzantine-Persian warfare"".María Rosa Menocal, argues that the Jewish dhimmis living under the caliphate, while allowed fewer rights than Muslims, were still better off than in the Christian parts of Europe. Jews from other parts of Europe made their way to al-Andalus, where in parallel to Christian sects regarded as heretical by Catholic Europe, they were not just tolerated, but where opportunities to practice faith and trade were open without restriction save for the prohibitions on proselytization.Bernard Lewis states:

Generally, the Jewish people were allowed to practice their religion and live according to the laws and scriptures of their community. Furthermore, the restrictions to which they were subject were social and symbolic rather than tangible and practical in character. That is to say, these regulations served to define the relationship between the two communities, and not to oppress the Jewish population.
Professor of Jewish medieval history at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Hayim Hillel Ben-Sasson, notes:

The legal and security situation of the Jews in the Muslim world was generally better than in Christendom, because in the former, Jews were not the sole ""infidels"", because in comparison to the Christians, Jews were less dangerous and more loyal to the Muslim regime, and because the rapidity and the territorial scope of the Muslim conquests imposed upon them a reduction in persecution and a granting of better possibility for the survival of members of other faiths in their lands. 
According to the French historian Claude Cahen, Islam has ""shown more toleration than Europe towards the Jews who remained in Muslim lands.""Comparing the treatment of Jews in the medieval Islamic world and medieval Christian Europe, Mark R. Cohen notes that, in contrast to Jews in Christian Europe, the ""Jews in Islam were well integrated into the economic life of the larger society"", and that they were allowed to practice their religion more freely than they could do in Christian Europe.According to the scholar Mordechai Zaken, tribal chieftains (also known as aghas) in tribal Muslim societies such as the Kurdish society in Kurdistan would tax their Jewish subjects. The Jews were in fact civilians protected by their chieftains in and around their communities; in return they paid part of their harvest as dues, and contributed their skills and services to their patron chieftain.


=== Hindus and Buddhists ===
By the 10th century, the Turks of Central Asia had invaded the Indic plains, and spread Islam in Northwestern parts of India. At the end of the 12th century, the Muslims advanced quickly into the Ganges Plain. In one decade, a Muslim army led by Turkic slaves consolidated resistance around Lahore and brought northern India, as far as Bengal, under Muslim rule. From these Turkic slaves would come sultans, including the founder of the sultanate of Delhi. By the 15th century, major parts of Northern India was ruled by Muslim rulers, mostly descended from invaders. In the 16th century, India came under the influence of the Mughals. Babur, the first ruler of the Mughal empire, established a foothold in the north which paved the way for further expansion by his successors. Although the Mughal emperor Akbar has been described as a universalist, most Mughal emperors were oppressive of native Hindu, Buddhist and later Sikh populations. Aurangzeb specifically was inclined towards a highly fundamentalist approach.


== Restrictions ==
There were a number of restrictions on dhimmis. In a modern sense the dhimmis would be described as second-class citizens.Although dhimmis were allowed to perform their religious rituals, they were obliged to do so in a manner not conspicuous to Muslims. Loud prayers were forbidden, as were the ringing of church bells and the blowing of the shofar. They were also not allowed to build or repair churches and synagogues without Muslim consent. Moreover, dhimmis were not allowed to seek converts among Muslims. In the Mamluk Egypt, where non-Mamluk Muslims were not allowed to ride horses and camels, dhimmis were prohibited even from riding donkeys inside cities. Sometimes, Muslim rulers issued regulations requiring dhimmis to attach distinctive signs to their houses.Most of the restrictions were social and symbolic in nature, and a pattern of stricter, then more lax, enforcement developed over time. The major financial disabilities of the dhimmi were the jizya poll tax and the fact dhimmis and Muslims could not inherit from each other. That would create an incentive to convert if someone from the family had already converted. Ira M. Lapidus states that the ""payment of the poll tax seems to have been regular, but other obligations were inconsistently enforced and did not prevent many non-Muslims from being important political, business, and scholarly figures. In the late ninth and early tenth centuries, Jewish bankers and financiers were important at the 'Abbasid court."" The jurists and scholars of Islamic sharia law called for humane treatment of the dhimmis.A Muslim man may marry a Jewish or Christian dhimmī woman, who may keep her own religion, but a Muslim woman cannot marry a dhimmī man unless he converts to Islam. Dhimmīs are prohibited from converting Muslims under severe penalties, while Muslims are encouraged to convert dhimmīs.


=== Jizya tax ===

Payment of the jizya obligated Muslim authorities to protect dhimmis in civil and military matters. Sura 9 (At-Tawba), verse 29 stipulates that jizya be exacted from non-Muslims as a condition required for jihad to cease. Islamic jurists required adult, free, healthy males among the dhimma community to pay the jizya, while exempting women, children, the elderly, slaves, those affected by mental or physical handicaps, and travelers who did not settle in Muslim lands. According to Abu Yusuf dhimmi should be imprisoned until they pay the jizya in full. Other jurists specified that dhimmis who don't pay jizya should have their heads shaved and made to wear a dress distinctive from those dhimmis who paid the jizya and Muslims.Lewis states there are varying opinions among scholars as to how much of a burden jizya was. According to Norman Stillman: ""jizya and kharaj were a ""crushing burden for the non-Muslim peasantry who eked out a bare living in a subsistence economy."" Both agree that ultimately, the additional taxation on non-Muslims was a critical factor that drove many dhimmis to leave their religion and accept Islam. However, in some regions the jizya on populations was significantly lower than the zakat, meaning dhimmi populations maintained an economic advantage. According to Cohen, taxation, from the perspective of dhimmis who came under Muslim rule, was ""a concrete continuation of the taxes paid to earlier regimes"". Lewis observes that the change from Byzantine to Arab rule was welcomed by many among the dhimmis who found the new yoke far lighter than the old, both in taxation and in other matters, and that some, even among the Christians of Syria and Egypt, preferred the rule of Islam to that of Byzantines. Montgomery Watt states, ""the Christians were probably better off as dhimmis under Muslim-Arab rulers than they had been under the Byzantine Greeks."" In some places, for example Egypt, the jizya was a tax incentive for Christians to convert to Islam.Some scholars have tried compute the relative taxation on Muslims vs non-Muslims in the early Abbasid period. According to one estimate, Muslims had an average tax rate of 17-20 dirhams per person, which rose to 30 dirhams per person when in kind levies are included. Non-Muslims paid either 12, 24 or 48 dirhams per person, depending on their taxation category, though most probably paid 12.The importance of dhimmis as a source of revenue for the Rashidun Caliphate is illustrated in a letter ascribed to Umar I and cited by Abu Yusuf: ""if we take dhimmis and share them out, what will be left for the Muslims who come after us? By God, Muslims would not find a man to talk to and profit from his labors.""The early Islamic scholars took a relatively humane and practical attitude towards the collection of jizya, compared to the 11th century commentators writing when Islam was under threat both at home and abroad.The jurist Abu Yusuf, the chief judge of the caliph Harun al-Rashid, rules as follows regarding the manner of collecting the jizya
No one of the people of the dhimma should be beaten in order to exact payment of the jizya, nor made to stand in the hot sun, nor should hateful things be inflicted upon their bodies, or anything of that sort. Rather they should be treated with leniency.
In the border provinces, dhimmis were sometimes recruited for military operations. In such cases, they were exempted from jizya for the year of service.


=== Administration of law ===
Religious pluralism existed in medieval Islamic law and ethics. The religious laws and courts of other religions, including Christianity, Judaism and Hinduism, were usually accommodated within the Islamic legal framework, as exemplified in the Caliphate, Al-Andalus, Ottoman Empire and Indian subcontinent. In medieval Islamic societies, the qadi (Islamic judge) usually could not interfere in the matters of non-Muslims unless the parties voluntarily chose to be judged according to Islamic law. The dhimmi communities living in Islamic states usually had their own laws independent from the Sharia law, such as the Jews who had their own Halakha courts.Dhimmis were allowed to operate their own courts following their own legal systems. However, dhimmis frequently attended the Muslim courts in order to record property and business transactions within their own communities. Cases were taken out against Muslims, against other dhimmis and even against members of the dhimmi's own family. Dhimmis often took cases relating to marriage, divorce or inheritance to the Muslim courts so these cases would be decided under sharia law. Oaths sworn by dhimmis in the Muslim courts were sometimes the same as the oaths taken by Muslims, sometimes tailored to the dhimmis' beliefs.Muslim men could generally marry dhimmi women who are considered People of the Book, however Islamic jurists rejected the possibility any non-Muslim man might marry a Muslim woman. Bernard Lewis notes that ""similar position existed under the laws of Byzantine Empire, according to which a Christian could marry a Jewish woman, but a Jew could not marry a Christian woman under pain of death"".


== Relevant texts ==


=== Quranic verses as a basis for Islamic policies toward dhimmis ===
Lewis states

The phrase ""Let there be no compulsion in religion: ..."", from Surah Al-Baqara 2:256 has sometimes been interpreted in the Islamic legal and theological traditions to mean followers of other religions should not be forced to adopt Islam
The phrase ""Unto you your religion, and unto me my religion."", from Surah Al-Kafirun 109:6 has been used as a ""proof-text for pluralism and coexistence"".
Surah Al-Baqara 2:62 has served to justify the tolerated position accorded to the followers of Christianity, Judaism, and Sabianism (Mandaeism) under Muslim rule.


=== Hadith ===
A hadith by Muhammad, ""Whoever killed a muʿāhid (a person who is granted the pledge of protection by the Muslims) shall not smell the fragrance of Paradise though its fragrance can be smelt at a distance of forty years (of traveling)."",  is considered to be a foundation for the protection of the People of the Book in Muslim ruled countries. Anwar Shah Kashmiri writes in his commentary on Sahih al-Bukhari Fayd al-Bari on this hadith: ""You know the gravity of sin for killing a Muslim, for its odiousness has reached the point of disbelief, and it necessitates that [the killer abides in Hell] forever. As for killing a non-Muslim citizen [muʿāhid], it is similarly no small matter, for the one who does it will not smell the fragrance of Paradise.""A similar hadith in regard to the status of the dhimmis: ""Whoever wrongs one with whom a compact (treaty) has been made [i.e., a dhimmi] and lays on him a burden beyond his strength, I will be his accuser.""


=== Constitution of Medina ===
The Constitution of Medina, a formal agreement between Muhammad and all the significant tribes and families of Medina (including Muslims, Jews and pagans), declared that non-Muslims in the Ummah had the following rights:
The security (dhimma) of God is equal for all groups,
Non-Muslim members have equal political and cultural rights as Muslims. They will have autonomy and freedom of religion.
Non-Muslims will take up arms against the enemy of the Ummah and share the cost of war. There is to be no treachery between the two.
Non-Muslims will not be obliged to take part in religious wars of the Muslims.


=== Khaybar agreement ===
A precedent for the dhimma contract was established with the agreement between Muhammad and the Jews after the Battle of Khaybar, an oasis near Medina. Khaybar was the first territory attacked and conquered by Muslims. When the Jews of Khaybar surrendered to Muhammad after a siege, Muhammad allowed them to remain in Khaybar in return for handing over to the Muslims one half their annual produce.


=== Pact of Umar ===

The Pact of Umar, traditionally believed to be between caliph Umar and the conquered Jerusalem Christians in the seventh century, was another source of regulations pertaining to dhimmis. However, Western orientalists doubt the authenticity of the pact, arguing it is usually the victors and not the vanquished who impose rather than propose, the terms of peace, and that it is highly unlikely that the people who spoke no Arabic and knew nothing of Islam could draft such a document. Academic historians believe the Pact of Umar in the form it is known today was a product of later jurists who attributed it to Umar in order to lend greater authority to their own opinions. The similarities between the Pact of Umar and the Theodosian and Justinian Codes of the Eastern Roman Empire suggest that perhaps much of the Pact of Umar was borrowed from these earlier codes by later Islamic jurists. At least some of the clauses of the pact mirror the measures first introduced by the Umayyad caliph Umar II or by the early Abbasid caliphs.


== Cultural interactions and cultural differences ==
During the Middle Ages, local associations known as futuwwa clubs developed across the Islamic lands. There were usually several futuwwah in each town. These clubs catered to varying interests, primarily sports, and might involve distinctive manners of dress and custom. They were known for their hospitality, idealism and loyalty to the group. They often had a militaristic aspect, purportedly for the mutual protection of the membership. These clubs commonly crossed social strata, including among their membership local notables, dhimmi and slaves – to the exclusion of those associated with the local ruler, or amir.Muslims and Jews were sometimes partners in trade, with the Muslim taking days off on Fridays and Jews taking off on Saturdays.Andrew Wheatcroft describes how some social customs such as different conceptions of dirt and cleanliness made it difficult for the religious communities to live close to each other, either under Muslim or under Christian rule.


== In modern times ==
The dhimma and the jizya poll tax are no longer imposed in Muslim majority countries. In the 21st century, jizya is widely regarded as being at odds with contemporary secular conceptions of citizens' civil rights and equality before the law, although there have been occasional reports of religious minorities in conflict zones and areas subject to political instability being forced to pay jizya.In 2009 it was claimed that a group of militants that referred to themselves as the Taliban imposed the jizya on Pakistan's minority Sikh community after occupying some of their homes and kidnapping a Sikh leader.As late as 2013, in Egypt jizya was reportedly being imposed by the Muslim Brotherhood on 15,000 Christian Copts of Dalga Village.In February 2014, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) announced that it intended to extract jizya from Christians in the city of Raqqa, Syria, which it controlled at the time. Christians who refused to accept the dhimma contract and pay the tax were to have to either convert to Islam, leave or be executed. Wealthy Christians would have to pay half an ounce of gold, the equivalent of $664 twice a year; middle-class Christians were to have to pay half that amount and poorer ones were to be charged one-fourth that amount. In June, 2014 the Institute for the Study of War reported that ISIL claims to have collected jizya and fay. On 18 July 2014 ISIL ordered the Christians in Mosul to accept the dhimma contract and pay the jizya or convert to Islam. If they refused to accept either of the options they would be killed.

She was the world record holder in several events in the 1920s – 1930s and was the first Japanese woman to win an Olympic medal. She was also the first woman to represent Japan at the Olympics.


== Biography ==
Hitomi was born in what is now part of Okayama City. In November 1923 during the 2nd Okayama Prefectural Women’s Games, she set an unofficial national record of 4m67 in the long jump event. In April 1924, Hitomi entered what is now the Japan Women's College of Physical Education. She returned to Okayama in October 1924 to participate in the 3rd Okayama Prefectural Women’s Games, where she set an unofficial world record of 10m33 in the triple jump event. She bested this record the following month at the 1924 Meiji Shrine Games in Tokyo, with a distance of 11m35 and also set an unofficial world record for the Javelin throw of 26m37.
In October 1925, Hitomi participated in the 4th Osaka Games, winning first place in the 50 metres event, and again besting her unofficial world record for the triple jump with a distance of 11m62. In the 1925 Meiji Shrine Games in Tokyo, she won both the 50 metres event and the triple jump.
In April 1926, Hitomi went to work for the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun newspaper. In May, she set new unofficial national records for the long jump (5m06), shot put (10m39), 100m hurdles (15m4) at the 3rd Women’s Olympics held by the newspaper at Miyoshino. In June, in a completion sponsored by the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun newspaper, she set new unofficial national records for the long jump (5m75) and the 4 × 100 metres relay (52s2).
In August 1926, Hitomi was selected to attend the ""2èmes Jeux mondiaux féminins FSFI"" games at Gothenburg, Sweden as the only Japanese woman athlete. She travelled by the Trans-Siberian Railway alone to Moscow, where a reporter from the Mainichi Shimbun met her and escorted her to Sweden. Competing in a total of six events, she received a gold medal for the long jump, with a distance of 5m50, setting a new official world record, as well as a gold medal for the standing long jump (2m49), silver medal for the discus throw (32m61) and bronze medal for the 100-yard dash (12.0 seconds). She also received an honorary prize from Alice Milliat, president of Fédération Sportive Féminine Internationale (FSFI) for the most individual points at 15.In May 1927, at the 3rd Women’s Athletic Meet at Meiji Shrine in Tokyo, Hitomi set two new unofficial world records for the 200-meter run (26.1 seconds) and the standing jump (2m61).  She also tied the world record for the 100-meter run at a meet in Osaka in June. At a meet in Tokyo in October of the same year, she unofficially tied the world record for the 50-meter sprint (6.4 seconds) as well as the 100-meter sprint (12.4 seconds). 
Hitomi continued to set unofficial new world records in early 1928, with the 400-meter run (59.0 seconds) and 100-meter sprint (12.4 seconds) in Tokyo. At the Olympic qualifying event in Osaka, she set new official world records for the long jump (5m98) and the 100-meter spring (12.0 seconds), and was one of the first women to be included into a Japanese Olympic Team.
During the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, Hitomi was the only Japanese woman athlete to compete. She entered the 100m, discus, and high jump individual events but had been concentrating most on the 100m. However, she lost this event in semifinals. She then decided to join 800m in haste (she hadn't run an 800m race at any official competition until that time), and as last-minute entries were still permitted, she was allowed to compete. Hitomi ran 2:26.2 in the preliminary and received a silver medal in the final with a time of 2:17.6, in a race won by Lina Radke in 2:16.8. She became the first Japanese woman to win an Olympic medal.

In April 1929 Hitomi achieved 217 points in the triathlon (100m, high jump, javelin) setting an unofficial world record at the 6th Japan Women’s Olympics at Miyoshino. In May, she set an official world record for the 200-meter run with a time 24.7 seconds in Tokyo. This was followed in October by new unofficial world records of 12.0 seconds for the 100m and 7.5 for the 60m sprint in Shenyang.
In early 1930, Hitomi was asked to lecture to women’s schools around the country. In July, she set new official national records for the long jump and javelin throw. In September, she participated in the ""3èmes Jeux mondiaux féminins FSFI"" games at Prague with five younger Japanese athletes. During this event, she won the gold medal for the long jump, silver medal for the triathlon and bronze medal for the javelin throw, despite suffering from a fever. She was also awarded a silver medal for her 12 individual points.
After the event, the Japanese team went on tour to Warsaw, Berlin, Brussels, Paris and London for competitions within the next half-month.
This extremely tough schedule took a toll on her health. Even after her return to Japan, she was asked to lecture, and visited sponsors and contributors in many Japanese cities without much rest. She was also surprised by the unexpected hostile reception to her athletic successes by the Japanese public. On March 25, 1931, she entered a hospital in Osaka under a false name to avoid publicity. Hitomi died from pneumonia on August 2, just three years after her Amsterdam Olympic 800m final.

== History ==
First recorded sighting of Ngulu Atoll was by the Spanish navigator Alonso de Arellano on 23 January 1565 on board of the patache San Lucas. In 1802 it was explored by Spanish naval officer Don Juan Lafita.
As with all of the Caroline Islands, sovereignty was sold by Spain to the Empire of Germany in 1899. The island came under the control of the Empire of Japan after World War I, and was subsequently administered under the South Seas Mandate. Following World War II, the island came under the control of the United States of America and was administered as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands from 1947, and became part of the Federated States of Micronesia from 1979.

== History and Former Programs ==
TechMission was founded in 2000 as an extension of the ministry of the PREP Computer Center, a Dorchester-based computer center run as a partnership between Bruce Wall Ministries and two local churches. Andrew Sears, who was then executive director of PREP, and other leaders of Christian community computer centers created TechMission's AC4 program (the Association of Christian Community Computer Centers) to connect and provide resources to similar computer centers. At its peak, it served over 500 centers, including ones affiliated with the Salvation Army, Christian Community Development Association, and the Association of Gospel Rescue Missions.TechMission became a separate non-profit entity in 2002. Over the next several years it developed the TechMission Corps internships program to provide full-time workers to serve in after-school, teen, and adult technology education programs, as well as providing the curriculum and software benefits of AC4 membership. It sent out interns to organizations in Boston, Los Angeles, Denver, Chicago, and Western Massachusetts. For several years it received AmeriCorps funding. Later, it was associated with TechMission's online university, City Vision University.In 2005, TechMission started its Safe Families Program, which promotes online safety through providing free training and web-filtering software. The TechMission Volunteer Network (ChristianVolunteering.org) was launched the following year. In 2007, TechMission launched UrbanMinistry.org, which used Web 2.0 technologies, such as user-submitted content to further promote collaboration and resource-sharing between Christian community development ministries. 


== City Vision University ==

City Vision University is a private online Christian university headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri, founded in 1998. Its degree programs equip urban ministry workers and nonprofit social service leaders to manage and develop their ministries.City Vision University is now the primary program offered by TechMission, and TechMission operates under the name of City Vision University.The university was originally founded by the Association of Gospel Rescue Missions as Rescue College, with one degree in Urban Missions. It was accredited by the Distance Education Accrediting Commission in 2005. When TechMission acquired it in 2008, it was renamed it City Vision College to serve a broader audience of social service organizations. It was later renamed City Vision University when it began offering  Master's programs. Since 2005, City Vision has launched programs in Addiction Counseling, Business, and Christian Ministry, including an MBA, and begun an internship/scholarship program by partnering with North American urban ministries.


== Media coverage and case study ==
In 2013, TechMission/City Vision and its founder, Andrew Sears, were covered by a Christianity Today article titled ""The Tech Poverty Fighter"". TechMission was also covered in Religion Today for its involvement in responding to the Boston Marathon Bombing. TechMission was also featured in a nonprofit case study by a group of Northeastern University professors published in the Case Research Journal.More recently, an article in Forbes online covered how City Vision's partnership with Saylor Academy provides a highly affordable pathway to college. Also, Andrew Sears was invited by the Clayton Christensen Institute to write on a standards strategy for stackable global credentials. Finally, in 2018, City Vision University was granted special recognition in the Pioneer Institute's Better Government Competition as an ""affordable educational option that offers degrees in Addiction Studies, Non-profit Management, Business, and Urban Missions for low-income individuals who want to help their own impoverished communities.""

","Der goldene Drache (The Golden Dragon) is an opera by Hungarian composer Péter Eötvös to a libretto by Roland Schimmelpfennig, based on his play of the same name. It premiered on 29 June 2014 at the Bockenheimer Depot in Frankfurt, conducted by the composer.


== History ==
Eötvös composed the opera in 2013/14 on a commission by ensemble modern and the Oper Frankfurt, his ninth opera. He had written operas on literary plots before, beginning with his first in 1998, Tri sestry (Three Sisters) after Anton Chekhov's play. The German libretto by Schimmelpfennig is based on his play of the same name. The play had premiered five years earlier at the Akademietheater in Vienna, staged by the author, and was awarded the Mülheimer Dramatikerpreis of 2010. Schimmelpfenig and Eötvös chose 21 short scenes from the play's 48 ""disparate snapshots"". The opera premiered on 29 June 2014 in Frankfurt's Bockenheimer Depot, conducted by the composer. It was staged by Elisabeth Stöppler, with stage design by Hermann Feuchter and costumes by Nicole Pleuler. The composer revised the opera in 2015. The Frankfurt production was then shown at the Bregenz Festival in August 2015.  The UK premiere was toured by Music Theatre Wales in 2017, during which time it was banned from the stage of the Hackney Empire for alleged ""yellowface"" racism.

","The Djiboutian National Army is the largest branch of the Djibouti Armed Forces and is based in the Djiboutian capital of Djibouti City. Djibouti has upgraded its Ground Forces with advanced additions from domestic engineering and modifications.

The official tasks of the armed forces include strengthening the country against external attack, maintaining border security. It is responsible for the defence of mainland Djibouti. During peacetime the military of Djibouti numbers approximately 9,000 with a reserve force of approximately 7,000


== Overview ==

Djibouti has a smaller military than its neighbors. However, its security stops against foreign incursions. In reforming the Djiboutian National Army, most of the available attention and financial resources have been directed to the development of the Land Forces. Clashes with the Eritrean Forces, in 2008, demonstrated the superior nature of the Djiboutian forces’ training and skills, but also highlighted the fact that the small military would be unable to counter the larger, if less well-equipped forces of its neighbours. The army has concentrated on mobility in its equipment purchases, suitable for patrol duties and counterattack but ill-suited for armoured war-fare. The 2008 border clashes at least temporarily swelled the ranks of the Djiboutian army, with retired personnel being recalled, but the military’s size and capabilities are much reduced since the 1990s. As a result of tensions with neighbors during the 1980s and early 2002, the Djiboutian Army refined existing strategic concepts and eventually formulated a plan to restructure its forces. Though wars were avoided, the threats from the 1980s and 2008 encouraged the army to address more effectively its major defense disadvantage: lack of strategic depth. Thus in the early 2000s it looked outward for a model of army organization that would best advance defensive capabilities by restructuring forces into smaller, more mobile units instead of traditional divisions. Over the years, Djiboutian Army has benefited from material and financial support of various countries such as France, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Morocco and the United States. Currently, the amount allocated to defense represents the largest single entry in the country’s budget. During, and since, the Djiboutian–Eritrean border conflict the army has exploded in size from its peacetime size of between 6,000 and 10,000.


== Organization ==

The Army has four military districts (the Tadjourah, Dikhil, Ali-Sabieh and Obock districts).Its maneuver units are:

One armoured regiment (Régiment Blindé) (Djibouti)(comprising a reconnaissance squadron, three armoured squadrons and an anti-smuggling squadron)
Four infantry regiments (each comprising three to four infantry companies and a support company)Arms Regiment of Dikhil (Régiment interarmes de Dikhil)
Bataillon interarmes d'Ali Sabieh (Ali Sabieh)
Arms Regiment of Tadjourah (Régiment interarmes de Tadjourah)

One rapid reaction regiment (Régiment d'action rapide) (Arta)(comprising four infantry companies and a support company)
One Republican Guard regiment
One artillery regiment (Régiment d'artillerie) (Djibouti)
One demining company
One signals regiment
One computer and information systems section
One logistics regiment
One maintenance company

He also appeared in the National Geographic Channel documentary Stonehenge Decoded, along with the PBS programme Nova: Secrets of Stonehenge.


== Early life and education ==
Parker Pearson was born in 1957. He would later inform interviewers that he first took an interest in the past when searching for fossils in his father's driveway gravel aged 4, extending that interest into the human past aged 6 when he read a library book entitled Fun with Archaeology. Deciding to study the subject at the undergraduate level, he attended the University of Southampton, attaining a first class BA with honours in Archaeology in 1979.He obtained his PhD from King's College, Cambridge in 1985, for a thesis titled ""Death, society and social change: the Iron Age of southern Jutland 200 BC – 600 AD"" in which he discussed what was known about the bog bodies of Iron Age Denmark; it would remain unpublished. Supervised by Ian Hodder as a post-graduate at Cambridge, Parker Pearson was a contemporary of Sheena Crawford, Daniel Miller, Henrietta Moore, Christopher Tilley and Alice Welbourn; these students were influenced by Hodder's ideas, then a pioneering part of the post-processualist current within archaeological theory.
Parker Pearson became interested in Marxism. In the 1984 anthology Ideology, Power and Prehistory, edited by Daniel Miller and Christopher Tilley, Parker Pearson published a paper in which he examined the pre-state societies of Jutland from a Marxist perspective. At the start of this paper, he noted that it had repercussions for Marxism in that its findings discerned ""a certain blurring between capitalism and non-capitalism"".


== Early career ==
From 1984 through to 1990, Parker Pearson worked as an Inspector of Monuments for English Heritage, and in 1989 he received membership to the Institute for Archaeologists. In 1990, he secured an academic teaching position at the Department of Archaeology at the University of Sheffield, where he would work for the next 21 years. In 1991 he was admitted as a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and in 1996 then became a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland.


== Stonehenge Riverside Project and UCL ==
From 2003 through to 2009, Parker Pearson directed the Stonehenge Riverside Project. The project garnered three major archaeological awards: the Andante Travel Archaeology Award (2008), the Royal Society of Northern Antiquaries Award (2009), and the UK Archaeological Research Project of the Year (2010). His work in leading the project also led to Parker Pearson being personally awarded the UK Archaeologist of the Year award in 2010.Parker Pearson and his team of researchers played a key role in the discovery of a new henge site along the River Avon that links to Stonehenge. This new site was uncovered through excavation during the Stonehenge Riverside Project and was given the name ""BlueStoneHenge"" or ""BlueHenge"" because traces of bluestones were found during the excavation.
From 2006 through to 2009, he served as the Vice-President of the Prehistoric Society. Interacting with various parts of the media, Parker Pearson has published articles in a variety of different sources, such as on the BBC website, has given interviews to groups such as Pagans for Archaeology and most recently discussed his career in an interview with Papers from the Institute of Archaeology.In 2012, Parker Pearson left the University of Sheffield and began teaching at the Institute of Archaeology, University College London, as Professor of British Later Prehistory.On 16 July 2015, he was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA).

Later that month he revealed to Extra that the baby was a sixth-month old boy.


== Career ==


=== 1999–2008: Child acting and breakthrough ===
His first role was an unpaid appearance in a Tim Hortons summer camp commercial. That appearance eventually landed him a position in a Pillsbury commercial, in which he poked the Pillsbury Doughboy and had his first role with lines. He found it ""really disheartening"" not to be cast in commercials after auditions. 
But in 1999, Cera moved beyond that: he was cast as Larrabe Hicks in the Canadian children's show I Was a Sixth Grade Alien, which ran for two seasons. That year, he also appeared in the television films What Katy Did and Switching Goals, starring the Olsen twins.The next year Cera made his theatrical film debut in the science fiction film Frequency (2000) as the son of Noah Emmerich's character. Cera also appeared in the films Steal This Movie! and Ultimate G's: Zac's Flying Dream in 2000. He had his first leading role in the latter film, which was presented in IMAX theaters. Cera appeared in several television films in 2001, including My Louisiana Sky and The Familiar Stranger. He also began voicing Josh Spitz in the animated series Braceface, which he continued until 2004.In 2002, Cera played the young Chuck Barris (played by Sam Rockwell) in the George Clooney-directed film Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. He provided the voice for Brother Bear – an anthropomorphic bear – in the 2003 The Berenstain Bears animated series, which aired for three seasons.

He had a role in the critically panned Fox pilot The Grubbs in 2002, which was never aired. But Cera successfully auditioned for a part in another Fox sitcom, Arrested Development. This began airing in November 2003 and ran for three seasons. The show follows the formerly wealthy and dysfunctional Bluth family, with Cera playing George Michael Bluth, the teenage son of character Michael Bluth, played by Jason Bateman. After three seasons, Fox canceled the series in 2006 due to low viewership, although it had received critical acclaim. In 2006, Cera created and starred in a parody of Impossible is Nothing, a video résumé created by Aleksey Vayner. Cera and his Arrested Development co-star Alia Shawkat guest-starred as a pair of college students in the teen noir drama Veronica Mars, in the episode ""The Rapes of Graff"" in 2006.Along with best friend Clark Duke, Cera wrote and starred in a series of short videos released on their website. Duke originated the idea, as he was enrolled at Loyola Marymount University and used their videos for his film school studies. In 2007, the pair signed a deal with CBS Television to write, produce, direct, and act in a short-form comedy series entitled Clark and Michael. The show featured guest stars such as David Cross, Andy Richter and Patton Oswalt, and was distributed via CBS's internet channel, CBS Innertube.

In May 2007, Cera appeared in a staged comedy video that shows him being fired from the lead role of the film Knocked Up, after belittling and arguing with its director Judd Apatow, in a scene that mocks the David O. Russell blow up on the set of I Heart Huckabees. Cera starred in the Apatow-produced teen comedy Superbad alongside Jonah Hill. Their characters in the film – two virgin teenagers about to graduate from high school whose party plans go awry – were based on the comedy's writers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. Superbad was released in cinemas in August 2007, topping the US box office for two weeks in a row.Cera's performance was critically acclaimed: The Atlantic reviewer said that the film ""belongs to Michael Cera"" for capturing ""teenage sexual abashment as indelibly as he did in the role of George Michael [on Arrested Development]."" The New York Times said that he was ""excellent"" and CNN praised Cera and Hill for playing ""off each other beautifully"".In November 2007, Cera hosted a live, staged version of Saturday Night Live; it was not broadcast due to the ongoing 2007 Writers Guild of America Strike. In his second film of 2007, Cera co-starred in Juno as Paulie Bleeker, a teenager who has impregnated his long-time school friend Juno (played by Elliot Page). For Superbad and Juno, Cera won Breakthrough Artist in the Austin Film Critics Association Awards 2007, and was included in Entertainment Weekly's ""30 Under 30"" list in February 2008.Cera starred alongside Kat Dennings in the romantic comedy-drama Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist (2008), in which they played two strangers who bond over their shared love of a band and try to find their secret show. He starred in the comedy Extreme Movie (2008), which was composed of vignettes focusing on teen sex. Cera held a recurring role on the comedy series Childrens Hospital from 2008 to 2016 as Sal Viscuso, a hospital staffer who is known only by his voice through an intercom.


=== 2009–2013: Varied success and stage debut ===

Cera played a fictionalized version of himself in the independent romantic comedy Paper Heart (2009). It explored the fictional relationship between Cera and the film's writer Charlyne Yi, also playing herself. Cera and Yi composed the film's score together. That year Cera starred opposite Jack Black in the comedy Year One, set during the Stone Age. The film, directed by Harold Ramis, was poorly received, although Time magazine critic Mary Pols said that Cera's performance saved the film from being a ""catastrophe"". In his final film of 2009, Cera starred in Youth in Revolt, an adaptation of the eponymous novel. He played a shy teenager named Nick Twisp who creates a destructive alter ego, François Dillinger, after becoming smitten with a girl, played by Portia Doubleday.Cera had also begun to write. His first published short story, ""Pinecone"", appeared in McSweeney's Quarterly thirtieth issue in 2009.Cera was cast as Scott Pilgrim in the film adaptation of the graphic novel series by Bryan Lee O'Malley. The film's director Edgar Wright had seen his work in Arrested Development and believed that Cera was an actor ""audiences will still follow even when the character is being a bit of an ass"". The film, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, follows Pilgrim, a musician who must battle the seven evil exes of his girlfriend Ramona (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead). It was released in cinemas in August 2010. It did poorly at the box office, grossing $47.7 million against a production budget of $85–90 million.Cera made a guest appearance in ""The Daughter Also Rises"", a 2012 episode of the animated sitcom The Simpsons, as the voice of Nick, a love interest to Lisa Simpson.Cera made his theater debut in a production of Kenneth Lonergan's play This Is Our Youth in a two-week run during March 2012 at the Sydney Opera House. The play also featured his Scott Pilgrim co-stars Kieran Culkin and Tavi Gevinson. A Broadway production at the Cort Theater opened in September 2014 and closed in January 2015. The New York Times theater critic Ben Brantley praised Cera for achieving ""something remarkable"": ""the sense of an amorphous being assuming and losing shape in the course of roughly 12 hours"". Also in 2012, Cera played a supporting role in the drama The End of Love and appeared in the short film The Immigrant.Arrested Development was revived for a fourth season in 2012 by Netflix, with Cera reprising his role as George Michael Bluth. Cera also worked in the writers' room and served as a consulting producer during its production. The season was released in May 2013.Cera collaborated with Chilean filmmaker Sebastián Silva on two films in 2013 – Magic Magic and Crystal Fairy & the Magical Cactus – both of which were filmed in Chile and premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival. He spent ""five hours a day learning Spanish"" for Magic Magic. Cera was featured most prominently in Crystal Fairy, in which he starred as a self-absorbed man travelling Chile with a woman named ""Crystal Fairy"" (played by Gaby Hoffmann) while bearing a cactus. Along with Reggie Watts, Tim & Eric, and Sarah Silverman, Cera created the web-based comedy YouTube channel Jash in March 2013, where he has posted short films which he directs and/or stars in. These films include the comedy-drama Gregory Go Boom (2013), in which Cera played a paraplegic man, and his directorial debut Brazzaville Teen-Ager (2013), co-starring Charles Grodin as his sick father. He played an exaggerated version of himself in the apocalyptic comedy film This Is the End, which was released in summer of 2013 and featured his Superbad co-stars Jonah Hill and Seth Rogen. Throughout 2013, Cera also appeared on Burning Love, a web spoof of reality dating competition shows, and on an episode of Drunk History as John Endecott. Cera had previously played Alexander Hamilton in a comedic retelling of Hamilton's duel with Aaron Burr on the show's first episode as a web series in 2008 before it was adapted into a television show.


=== 2014–present ===
Cera appeared with his Arrested Development co-star David Cross' 2014 film Hits, playing a marijuana dealer. He also co-starred alongside John Hawkes and Sally Hawkins in Charlie Kaufman's television pilot How & Why, which was rejected by FX. After a brief, ""menacing"" appearance in the drama Entertainment (2015), Cera appeared in the prequel to the 2001 comedy film Wet Hot American Summer, the comedy series Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp and in the Christmas musical comedy film A Very Murray Christmas as Bill Murray's fictional talent agent. Cera then voiced a hot dog trying to escape his fate in a supermarket in the animated comedy Sausage Party (2016).In 2015, Cera made a cameo on Louis C.K.'s Louie on FX, in the season five episode ""Sleepover"" alongside Glenn Close, John Lithgow, and Matthew Broderick.Cera had five film releases in 2017, the first of which was the animated superhero comedy The Lego Batman Movie, in which he voiced the Batman's sidekick Robin. He played a supporting role as a sleazy car salesman in the comedy How to Be a Latin Lover and co-starred in Janicza Bravo's first full-length feature, the comedy-drama Lemon. He played an actor described as having a ""wedge of hair that makes him look like Frédéric Chopin crossed with Eraserhead"", by Variety critic Owen Gleiberman. Cera starred opposite Abbi Jacobson in the drama Person to Person, focusing on the struggles of different people over the course of one day in New York City. Cera and Jacobson are featured as a pair of crime reporters investigating a possible murder.

New Labour Unity Party,"['All articles lacking sources', 'All stub articles', 'Articles lacking sources from December 2009', 'Defunct political parties in Fiji', 'Fiji stubs', 'Oceanian political party stubs', 'Political parties disestablished in 2006', 'Political parties established in 2001']","The New Labour Unity Party was a Fijian political party, which broke away from the Fiji Labour Party in May 2001.  It was founded by Tupeni Baba, a former Deputy Prime Minister and Labour Party stalwart, who had become dissatisfied with Mahendra Chaudhry's leadership and expressed fears that if Chaudhry, who had been deposed in the Fiji coup of 2000, returned as Prime Minister, there could be another coup.  Other prominent Fijians associated with the party included Ratu Meli Vesikula.
In the parliamentary election of 2001, the New Labour Unity Party called for the strengthening of the independence of the judiciary, which had been undermined by government defiance.  It also advocated a reduction in Value Added Tax, and for its complete removal on essential items.  A NLUP government would work to build a non-racialist Fiji in the ethic of ""love thy brother,"" and would ban all forms of unfair discrimination.  It also called for a parliamentary code of conduct to end corruption.  The party won two of the 45 seats it contested, but Baba himself was defeated.  During the campaign, the party had been hurt by revelations that it had received F$200,000 from Peter Foster, a controversial Australian businessman who had been convicted of fraud. Foster actually invested over $1 million in supporting New Labour and ran what was described as a very slick and professional election campaign. Foster said he supported Dr Baba because he saw him as the ""Nelson Mandela of the South Pacific.""
In the House of Representatives, the NLUP delegation split after the election.  Kenneth Zinck joined the government benches and was appointed to the Cabinet as Minister for Labour, Industrial Relations, and Productivity, while Ofa Swann decided to join the Opposition.  Most members of the party decided in June 2002 to join with three other parties to form the new Fiji Democratic Party, under the leadership of Filipe Bole.  This party dissolved itself in April 2005, in order to join the newly formed National Alliance Party of Fiji, led by Ratu Epeli Ganilau.  A rump of the NLUP continues under the leadership of Tomasi Tokalauvere, a trade unionist.  The party secretary is Loraini Tulele.
On 5 December 2003, Radio New Zealand reported that the NLUP had expelled Zinck from the party, following his refusal to quit his Cabinet portfolio and join the opposition, saying that his decision breached the party's 2001 election manifesto. Zinck had allegedly ignored several warnings from the party that he would be expelled if he did not resign from the Cabinet, as directed.  As of August 2005, however, Zinck is still officially registered by the Fijian Parliament as a member of the NLUP.
On 21 August, Zinck confirmed reports that Tokalauvere was trying to have the party deregistered.  He said that Tokalauvere had no authority to do so, however.  The Fiji Sun reported on 11 February 2006 that the party had in fact been deregistered, and that Zinck and Swann were both exploring other options for the 2006 election.","The New Labour Unity Party was a Fijian political party, which broke away from the Fiji Labour Party in May 2001.

== History ==
The name ""General Healthcare Group"" dates to 1993, when AMI, a US for-profit hospital provider which had expanded into the UK in the 1970s, renamed itself BMI Healthcare, creating GHG as its corporate group name. AMI had been floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1988, and was acquired by Generale de Santé (a subsidiary of Compagnie Générale des Eaux) in 1990.In 1997 both Generale de Santé and GHG were acquired by private equity group Cinven, with BMI's international activities transferred to Generale de Santé, leaving BMI Healthcare active only in the UK. In 1998 Amicus Healthcare Group was acquired from Compass Group and merged into GHG. Cinven sold GHG to another private equity group in 2000, and a consortium led by South African healthcare group Netcare acquired the company in 2006.In 2008 BMI purchased nine hospitals in Birmingham, Bury St Edmunds, Gerrards Cross, Harrogate, Huddersfield, Lancaster, Lincoln, North London and Nottingham from Nuffield Health to build on their existing BMI Healthcare business.In 2018, BMI sold 35 of its hospitals to Hospital Topco Limited.

Nottingham lace curtain machine,"['1846 introductions', 'Articles with short description', 'Commons category link is locally defined', 'English inventions', 'Industrial Revolution in England', 'Lace-making machinery', 'Short description matches Wikidata']",The lace curtain machine is a lace machine invented by John Livesey in Nottingham in 1846. It was an adaptation of John Heathcoat's bobbinet machine. It made the miles of curtaining which screened Victorian and later windows.,"The lace curtain machine is a lace machine invented by John Livesey in Nottingham in 1846. It was an adaptation of John Heathcoat's bobbinet machine. It made the miles of curtaining which screened Victorian and later windows.


== History ==
The forerunner of the mechanical lace-making machine was the 1589 stocking frame. This is a weaving frame fitted with a bar of bearded needles that passed back and forth, to and from the operator. There was no warp. The beards were simultaneously depressed by a presser bar catching the weft and holding it back for a course, making a row of loops. After Jeremiah Strutt had modified the machine in 1759 to make it capable of ribbing, in 1764 Hammond introduced a tickler stick to transfer the loops 2 or 3 gaits sideways. In this way, mechanical lace-making was born.  But there was no carriage or comb, and the operations continued to be performed sequentially by the operator.
Invented by John Livesey in Nottingham in 1846, the lace curtain machine was initially seen as a form of a Leavers machine - a modification of the Circular. The Leavers mesh tends to be hexagonal, while the Curtain machine produces a straight mesh. The use of Jacquards for producing patterned lace was well established. At the 1851 Great Exhibition, curtains 5 yards (460 cm) long by 2 yards (180 cm) wide were displayed. Their extensive designs required over 12,000 Jacquard cards. The curtain lace industry prospered with the advent of the fashion for large rising sash windows. The width of the frame ultimately increased to 420 inches (11 m), and in 1928 a machine of 300 inches (7.6 m) was considered to be the smallest viable size. Its supremacy was challenged in 1900 by the popularity of Schiffli embroideries produced on the bobbinet, then in the 1950s by the Raschel  and the use of artificial fibres.

Viewed from the front, the frame is similar to that of a Leavers machine. However, its action is different, as it produces a square net rather than a hexagonal one. The Nottingham lace curtain machine only has one warp, and the patterning threads are carried on a spool, not on a beam. The terms to describe the actions are the same as those used for a Leavers machine: rise, fall, right, left, sley, carriage, comb etc. The lace is collected at the top, unlike the Pusher machine, where it is collected at the bottom. Collection is via a take-up beam; a spiky roller beneath it called the porcupine regulated the take-up tension.


=== The curtain machine ===
There are four groups of thread: warp, top board, bottom board and bobbin. On a 10-point, 360-inch machine there are four groups of 3,600 threads, making a total of 14,400 threads.  (The term 'point' refers to the number of warps per inch.)

The warp passes down the lace in straight lines. The warp beam is at the bottom; the thread passes through a sley, and then through the front guide bar (also known as the warp bar). The warp bar is controlled by a cam. All the warps remain in parallel; they cannot pattern. Their function is to generate the skeletal support for the fabric.
The top board threads can act as both warp and weft - they can pillar to the weft, or they can shog gaits in the pattern as weft. The threads pass through tensioning springs, then through a sley and through holes in the back guide bar (third bar, coarse spool bar).
The bottom board (also known as a Swiss board or occasionally beam) was not present in the early machines. It acts as the weft in both the ground and the pattern. This contains the finer threads. If the pattern is complex, spools must be used, but a beam can be used where the pattern is fairly even. The threads pass through a tensioning spring and through holes in the  middle guide bar (also known as a Swiss bar or fine spool bar).
The bobbin threads tie the top and bottom board threads to the pillars. The bobbin threads are carried on brass bobbins held in carriages that are swung back and forth on combs in a pushing and catching routine.  Pillaring is controlled by the pillaring cam; when the net is being made the pillars must be connected, which can be done by the spool threads (top or bottom board). These are secured each time by the bobbin threads. Patterning or gimping is created by using longer shogs on the spool threads. There are three guide bars controlled by work cams. These allow a shogging movement across 2, 3 or 4 gaits. The cams cannot be stopped, but threads in the middle and back bars can be interrupted by a Jacquard mechanism. Each bobbin thread has its own jack - a steel wire that can interrupt its movement and create a hole in the pattern, in effect leaving off a tie.

== Career ==


=== Degree ===
Throughout his career McKenzie has achieved the following degrees: BFA (with honours) at the University of Florida, Department of Fine Arts (1984); MA (with honours) at the University of Florida, Department of English (1987); and finally a PhD at the New York University, Tisch School of the Arts, Department of Performance Studies (1996). McKenzie has held a number of professional positions including; Writing Instructor,  Department of English, University of Florida (1985–1987); Assistant Professor, Department of Multimedia, The University of the Arts (1999–2001); and Associate and Full Professor, Department of English, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (2006–2007); Full Professor, Department of English, University of Wisconsin-Madison; and Dean's Fellow for Media and Design and Visiting Professor of English at Cornell University.


== Influences ==
During his time as an undergraduate at the University of Florida McKenzie was heavily influenced by the work of Professor Gregory Ulmer and his theories of applied Grammatology. By taking film classes with Ulmer and fellow Professor Robert Ray, McKenzie began to explore art informed by theories of relativity and psychoanalysis. This led to an interest in the deconstructive and grammatological projects of Jacques Derrida. The first lesson that Ulmer taught McKenzie was that even the most critical of theories, such as Marx and Freud, came from creativity and invention. Therefore, for McKenzie theory became a form of applied conceptual art. The second lesson Ulmer taught McKenzie was to approach the classroom as a performance space, a site where materials (bodies, ideas, media) could be mixed together to create pedagogical events.Another influence for McKenzie has been performance artist Laurie Anderson as he was fascinated by the complexity and simplicity of her work. He wrote his master's theses on Anderson's United States Parts: I-IV where he explored Anderson's multimedia performance art using Derrida's notion of grammatological, generalised writing, while also trying to explore the relation of experimental performance and the highly normative theory of performativity articulated by Lyotard. In his essay ‘Laurie Anderson for Dummies’ McKenzie analyses Anderson's performance stories from the Never Bible and her CD ROM, ‘Puppet Motel’; and how they are related to his interest in performative pedagogies.The years at Florida shaped McKenzie's approach to theory and life and Ulmer's teaching left a big thumbprint on his mind. ‘The experimental approach to theory is constant, the emphasis on generalised writing, multimedia, mixing them up. Anagrammatology’.


== McKenzie's concepts and views on performance theory ==
Jon McKenzie has various views on performance theory. He refers to performance as having multiple definitions: performance as spectacle, performance as a machine's effectiveness, and a government representative's performance during speeches. All these concepts are becoming ‘entwined’ (McKenzie, 2003; 118) due to the different paradigms involved around the phenomena in defining what is performance. McKenzie describes the whole world as becoming a ‘test site,’ (McKenzie, 2003; 120) in which everything is being tested as a performance. McKenzie believes that the world is entering ‘an age of global performance.' He believes that performance has become globalized and that everything can be perceived as a performance. In the article, 'Democracy’s Performance,' he notes that ‘performance practices have gone digital... merging art, activism and technology to create electronic civil disobedience’ (McKenzie, 2003; 117). According to McKenzie, performance studies is constantly ‘contesting’ (McKenzie, 2003; 117) and expanding its own concepts through ‘experimental’ (McKenzie, 2003; 117) ways of teaching and research. McKenzie considers the definition of performance in light of globalization to be ‘too American’ (McKenzie, 2006; 7) because it is problematically seen as universal, where, in actuality, each piece of performance is contextually unique.
Another of McKenzie's theories, influenced by the work of Judith Butler, Jean-François Lyotard and Herbert Marcuse, is that performance has formed a ‘performance stratum’ (McKenzie, 2003;117). This stratum involves the intersection of power and knowledge; although he admits that it has not ‘fully installed itself’ (McKenzie, 2001; 6); he has come to this conclusion by extending Michel Foucault's theories of discipline, in which he believes there needs to be a term to explain the different degrees of performance; cultural, organizational, and technological, although this term is only new due to the emergence of the globalization of performance; which is rapidly increasing. Referencing Friedrich Nietzsche, he also suggests that Gay Science might help us to develop a methodology that can be practiced within performance by interweaving paradigms and researching different types performance. In the article ‘Democracy’s Performance’ he suggests that global performance contains complex forces and affects; the effects being a system of barometers including the Eurobarometer, which are a group of demographic constituencies which take public surveys based on the performance of democracy in countries and regions across the world. The thoughts expressed in the article by McKenzie are extended thoughts based on research for his book Perform or Else.McKenzie notes in ‘Performance and Global Transference’ that cultural performances contribute to the contemporary process of globalization. Although he generally sees the globalization of performance as having a negative impact, he does see some positive aspects, such as: the emergence of universal human rights, establishment of the world court (international court of justice), annual conferences on global warming and the AIDS crisis, and the formation of Performance Studies International, co-founded by noted American feminist scholar Peggy Phelan.
A unifying theme throughout all of McKenzie's work is researching what performance might mean in an attempt to build a clear and unique single definition that sums up various paradigms in performance studies globally. It is understood that his goal by publishing materials is to create an understanding of different theorists and researchers around the world and their different understanding of terms and approach to cultural performance and help solve problematic queries regarding to the definition of performance which is increasingly difficult as the further you research the more contradicting performance becomes to its previous definitions.  This is established as his mission statement within ‘Is Performance Studies Imperialist?’(McKenzie, 2006).


== StudioLab ==
In 1996 McKenzie decided to tackle the question: ‘How does an artist perform technologically?’ With this performance in mind he taught ‘Electronic Performance’ as a graduate course in the summer of 1996 and then in an undergraduate workshop in the autumn. McKenzie explains that ‘the focus of both workshops was to explore electronic performance as the cross of cultural performance (such as theatre, ritual and performance art) and technological performance (ranging from clocks and answering machines to computers and the internet). McKenzie explains that both humans and technologies perform: ‘interfaces are thus always joint performances’. McKenzie believed that it was critically important for his drama students to experience and experiment with new media. Student participation is a high expectation in McKenzie's classes and he has created a framework that allows students to add their own work.The StudioLab is designed to take place in studio and computer lab environments, allowing students to develop critico-creative projects and digital skills using models drawn from cultural performance: theatre, performance art, ritual and practices of everyday life. In the studio, the students work in ‘bands’ to collaboratively conceive and develop performative aspects of their projects. StudioLab bands contain specialised players; one student might focus on imagery, another on text and another on interactive elements. However, in the lab, the same students work in different groupings called ‘guilds’ to develop the electronic elements needed by the bands. Guilds are technically monochromatic, composed of specialised players such as Photoshoppers, Hypertextualists and Interactivists. Individual guild members then bring their skills back to their bands in the studio, integrating them into projects. Moving between studio and lab, band and guild, these projects unfold through the interlacing of bodies, ideas and media. McKenzie's role in this process is one of producer giving his students advice on how to mix their tracks. The interlacing of the bands and guilds was an important discovery for McKenzie, for it took the collaboration to a higher level.One project McKenzie used was ‘Interface in Everyday Life’ combining performance art and Donald Norman’s work on interface design. Students were given the opportunity to pick a common interface, explore the activities the design brings forth, and create a live performance from this exploration. They then tried to translate the performance back into a Web interface. Another project is a transformation of Brenda Laurel’s Computers as Theatre, which developed a theory of human-computer interaction using Aristotle's Poetics. Students created actual and virtual events by substituting another performance form for Greek tragedy: Kabuki, solo performance, Dada, Sumo as well as the theatre of Brecht, Artuad, Schechner and LeCompte.In this interview McKenzie was asked about his opinion about the validity of collaborative student Web projects. He explained that theatre has traditionally been a collaborative activity: ‘If dramatic writing has traditionally been a solitary activity, producing theatre has always been collaborative: actors, costume and set designers, technical crews, etc. It's this collaborative dimension that makes theatre so applicable to creating new media, which requires integrating so many different skills and media. McKenzie believes that the model of individual genius that has dominated modern aesthetics is giving way to collaborative modes of creativity. For him, all creativity is social and recombinant’. McKenzie goes on to talk about the process of updating and maintaining a large website like StudioLab. He joked that ‘Maintaining a Website was artificial life!’ He explains that the joke makes sense on two levels: First, anyone who builds and maintains a site knows that it takes some effort and if you want it to be really interesting, it takes a lot of effort so much that it can take over your life for a while. Second, the joke suggests Manuel De Landa's notion of inorganic life, which teaches us something important about human-computer interfaces, namely, that there are feedback loops and machinic processes everywhere, operating in all mediums—organic and inorganic—and doing so at very different scales and temporalities. Machinic processes are more than tools, more than mediums even: at a general level, they make up everything.In sum: StudioLab is characterised by the circulation between studio and lab environments, by collaborative learning in different sociotechnical groupings and by the mixing and fine-tuning of physical, conceptual and multimedia elements.Jon McKenzie's second book published in 2019 Transmedia Knowledge for Liberal Arts and Community Engagement: A StudioLab Manifesto provides an overview of his StudioLab pedagogy. 


== McKenzie Stojnić ==
In 2017, McKenzie co-founded the media performance group McKenzie Stojnić together with his spouse, performance theorist and artist Aneta Stojnić. Their first performance, ""Thought Action Figures EPISODE 7: THE THINKERS,"" premiered on 23rd May 2018 at Spring Festival in Utrecht. McKenzie Stojnić operated at the intersections of art & life, theory & practice, playing & reality and episteme & doxa and performed across a variety of media. The main focus and means of their collaborative work was Thought Action Figures a.k.a. TAF. TAF is an original concept conceived by Jon McKenzie and developed by McKenzie and Stojnić in a series of lecture-performances, comics, videos, talks, publications, workshops etc.
They proposed TAFs as a new mode of thinking and performing in digital age. TAFs overcome the limitations of ideation and literacy for the benefits of figuration, digitally and transmedia knowledge. McKenzie explains: “With transmedia knowledge, a new image of thought emerges: Thought-Action Figures, which are to digitality what ideas are to literacy, basic forms of thought and existence (recall that Plato interpreted Being as eidos). Thought-Action Figures are not limited to human figures: animals, plants, machines, systems, processes, materialities, symbols and other abstract entities—all become thought-action figures via transmediation, movement through mediums deemed material, spiritual, cultural, etc. within different ontologies.”. Aneta Stojnić elaborates: “TAFs are figures of thought as well as concrete objects that allow us to transform and perform ideas, concepts, and knowledge across different media and in variety of forms. TAFs are always created in relation, and they always produce meaning: that is what distinguishes them from simple objects. These relations are multiple, fluid, networked, transversal, and always in motion.”


== Published literature ==


=== Definition ===
McKenzie's most heavily cited work is the 2001 book Perform or Else: From Discipline to Performance. In his book ‘Perform or Else,'  McKenzie questions whether there is a single and conclusive definition capturing all types of performance. In the first part McKenzie reviews the research area Performance Studies. Including how theatre transcended into performance as well as industries and corporations emergence into performance. Due to its complexity, there is no fixed definition of performance despite its vast field of research. McKenzie attempts to find a universal and coherent definition of performance and questions whether it is feasible to do so. He then explores why and how performance has emerged as a theoretical paradigm within the past century. He proves why there is a need for a single coherent definition of performance and shows how it goes beyond a concept of theory for theatre. McKenzie's research uses the 1986 NASA Challenger Space Shuttle shuttle flight as a case study linking his theory to that of Marcuse, Lyotard and Butler, and assesses its performative qualities. He challenges himself to create a meta-performance theory called ‘perfumance’ (McKenzie, 2001: 232). Perfumance is a neologism from McKenzie's research into finding a global definition for performance. A perfumance incorporates the sense of smell into performance, as performance as a manifesto with an alluring smell to it, that everyone is drawn to and pulled in and trapped, due to its complex meaning. McKenzie notes that ‘perfumance emits emissions of the future’ (McKenzie, 2001: 232). Meaning that it can finally end the ongoing discussion battle of performance; solving the problems of global communications.


=== Politics ===
In a platform about performance studies Jon McKenzie gives a speech titled ‘Democratizing Torture: Three Scenarios’ McKenzie addresses to the participants that society is ‘dictated’ (McKenzie, 2005:1) by performance and that people are ‘judged’ (McKenzie, 2005:1) on whether their actions can be tested as performance according to the State of the art. Performance he continues has become to find an ‘emergence of freedom’ (McKenzie, 2005:1) due to the large ‘undetermined’ (McKenzie, 2005:1) field which overlaps other fields such as institutions and processes. He continues by saying that ‘everything and everybody’ (McKenzie, 2005:1) is being judged by its potential in performance and theorists are now beginning to predict the new performance hierarchies. He then begins to discuss three scenarios based on this new immergence of performance and democracy and what he predicts by using these three scenarios what the future entails because of this performance. The first being an extension of today's society he calls this ‘clean torture’ (McKenzie, 2005:2) which entails; stun guns, stress position and highly public human rights initiatives. He calls this ‘torture as usual’ (McKenzie, 2005:2). He addresses the second scenario as ‘society of the spectacle of the Scaffold’ (McKenzie, 2005:2) of which entails politicians becoming ‘security obsessed’ (McKenzie, 2005:2)  because of the increasing danger of terrorism. This meaning the theatre of torture goes public as civilians begin to support ‘enhanced interrogation techniques’ (McKenzie, 2005:2). The final scenario McKenzie discusses is ‘A world without torture’ (McKenzie, 2005:2). He explores the avenues we need to explore to abolish torture on a global mass. He argues that international human rights have helped develop clean torture techniques rather than the brutal torture techniques developed in earlier decades.


=== Society ===
In 2005 McKenzie wrote another article titled ‘Hacktivism and Machinic Performance’ in which he attempted to define both terms in context to the social climate of today. He referred to his book ‘Perform or Else’ when he defines Hacktivism: ‘the emergence of political activism within digital environments, primarily but not exclusively, the Internet’. McKenzie's goal has been to theorise the performance of hacktivism in hope of connecting his research on electronic civil disobedience to his ongoing performance research. Whilst being interested in cultural performances such as performance art and political theatre, McKenzie has focused on the relationships between cultural performance and ‘high performance’ technologies and ‘peak performance’ organisations. As well as being interested in these three performances (cultural, organisations and technological) McKenzie is most interested in performance as the defining modality of power in contemporary society. He goes on to define machinic performances as ‘arising when different processes ‘recur’ or communicate across diverse systems, thereby creating performances that escape subjective control and even objective analysis...They happen at multiple sites through multiple agents, both human and technological. Machinic performances pose a real challenge to study, as to research a machinic performance is perhaps to become part of it’. McKenzie suggests that two areas where machinic performance was most visible are interface design and socio-technical systems. In new media interface design is primarily in discrete human-computer interactions, such as an exchange in front of an automated teller machine (ATM) or on a web page. The machinic performance is precisely the interaction between an individual and a PC or other device, each providing the other with information. From another perspective, however, McKenzie states that all human-computer interactions are actually close-ups of larger socio-technological systems. It is not simply one person standing at an ATM: it is a customer base interacting with a financial institution or even a whole client sector interacting with a multinational banking industry. McKenzie believes that socio-technical systems perform machinically: they entail communication across diverse structures and processes, and their ‘events’ are not confined to discrete times and places, but are instead distributed across many performance sites.


=== Speech ===
In the article ‘Democracy’s Performance’ (McKenzie, 2003), McKenzie extends his discussion and research on performance he produced in ‘Perform or Else’ (McKenzie, 2001) by discussing the definition of performance further. He begins this by using George W. Bush’s speech; his announcement of war on terrorism as a performance, he tests his speech to see, according to the term performance, whether it is indeed a performance as such. McKenzie goes on to discuss how performance has become involved in a power matrix and the ‘will to power’ (McKenzie, 2003: 119) performance stratum.  Through discussing this he gives his theory structure by using evidence linking the idea ‘the will to become in power’ (McKenzie, 2003: 119) to performance through George Bush. He does this by showing how Bush's will makes his speech become a performance as he emphasizes his democratic views in order to gain the public's faith. McKenzie argues that Bush used a weak point in America by tackling the 9/11 attacks by blaming those responsible in a historical and philosophical perspective by linking the attacks of Al Qaeda and comparing these attacks to those of Pearl Harbor.


=== Culture ===
In the article ‘Performance and Global Transference’ (McKenzie, 2001) McKenzie analyses the impact of globalization on cultural performances. Commenting on previous research from the article ‘Democracy’s Performance’ (McKenzie, 2003) he continues his theory by saying that the stratum he has developed to make a clearer term for performance has not been ‘fully installed’ (McKenzie, 2003:6) this being due to the emergence of globalization and the era we are heading into of global performance.
His research in performance theory has inspired performance arts groups, such as Doorika, mentioned in the feminist theory journal Women & Performance.

== History ==
The Casa Fuerte de la Cruceta was finished in 1773 for the purpose of housing cavalry units. The fortress was one of the westernmost defensive positions built in the 18th century by King Charles III of Spain to defend the area of Almería and the Cabo de Gata. It was originally intended to house  soldiers who were tasked with guarding the areas between Torre García and Perdigal. The King approved plans for its construction in 1771 and works were completed in 1773. In 1778 the fort had a permanent garrison of 14 soldiers.By 1830, the fort was abandoned by the army but in 1857, it was transferred to the control of the Carabineros. In 1941, the fort was garrisoned by the Guardia Civil.
The fortress was restored in 2005 and is accessible as a part of the waterfront of El Toyo.

Streptopelia,"[""Articles with 'species' microformats"", 'Articles with short description', 'Bird genera', 'CS1 French-language sources (fr)', 'Commons category link from Wikidata', 'Short description matches Wikidata', 'Streptopelia', 'Taxa named by Charles Lucien Bonaparte']","Streptopelia is a genus of birds in the pigeon and dove family Columbidae. These are mainly slim, small to medium-sized species. The upperparts tend to be pale brown and the underparts are often a shade of pink. Many have a characteristic black-and-white patch on the neck and monotonous cooing songs.
The heartland of this genus is Africa, but several species occur in tropical South Asia. As a group, this genus is highly successful; many species are abundant in a range of habitats in the tropics and two now have a much more extensive distribution. The Eurasian collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto) naturally expanded out of its original range of the warmer temperate regions from southeastern Europe to Japan to colonise the rest of Europe, reaching as far west as Great Britain by 1960 and Ireland soon after. It has also been introduced into the U.S. and, as of 1999, it had been reported from 22 states and was still spreading rapidly.","Streptopelia is a genus of birds in the pigeon and dove family Columbidae.

It has also been introduced into the U.S. and, as of 1999, it had been reported from 22 states and was still spreading rapidly.


== Taxonomy ==
The genus Streptopelia was introduced in 1855 by the French ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte. The name is from the Ancient Greek στρεπτός (streptos) - literal meaning ""twisted"" but, by extension, ""wearing a torc"" (i.e. twisted metal collar) - and πελεια (peleia) meaning ""wild dove"". Also in 1855, the English zoologist George Robert Gray designated the type species as Streptopelia risoria, the Barbary dove. Although Streptopelia risoria has been confirmed as a valid name by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, the Barbary dove may be a domesticated form of the African collared dove (Streptopelia roseogrisea).A DNA sequence analysis has concluded that the genus consists of three distinct lineages. One contains the laughing dove and the spotted dove, which have long been recognized as having distinct morphology and behavior. The second group contains most of the other species, except for the Malagasy turtle dove and the pink pigeon, which appear to be the surviving species of an endemic Madagascar/Mascarenes radiation and have at times been placed in other genera. The two-species lineages appear to be each other's closest relatives and cannot be firmly assigned to either Columba or Streptopelia (although overall they seem to be close to the latter). Thus, it might be best to split the two minor lineages off as distinct genera, namely Spilopelia for the first (which, although not having priority over Stigmatopelia, which occurs earlier on the page, is chosen on the first reviser principle) and Nesoenas for the second.


== Species ==

The genus contains 15 species:
European turtle dove Streptopelia turtur
Dusky turtle dove, Streptopelia lugens
Adamawa turtle dove, Streptopelia hypopyrrha
Oriental turtle dove Streptopelia orientalis
Sunda collared dove, Streptopelia bitorquata
Philippine collared dove, Streptopelia dusumieri
Eurasian collared dove, Streptopelia decaocto
Burmese collared dove, Streptopelia xanthocycla
African collared dove, Streptopelia roseogrisea
White-winged collared dove, Streptopelia reichenowi
Mourning collared dove, Streptopelia decipiens
Red-eyed dove, Streptopelia semitorquata
Ring-necked dove, Streptopelia capicola
Vinaceous dove, Streptopelia vinacea
Red collared dove, Streptopelia tranquebaricaThe genera Spilopelia and Nesoenas were formerly placed in Streptopelia, but have since been separated out to make the genus monophyletic.

This histone methyltransferase performs its biological activity by catalyzing the trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3). The biological function of this gene allows for it to transcriptionally repress the target, Hox,  inhibitor genes of osteochodrogenesis. Ezh2 is crucial for epigenetic regulation of specific patterning during osteochondrogenesis, or bone and cartilage development, of the craniofacial skeletal elements.  By repressing inhibitors, Ezh2 promotes bone and cartilage formation in facial skeletal features arising from the neural crest.  Above average Ezh2 expression has become a biological marker for the most aggressive form for breast cancer known as Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC). But in 2013, a study performed by Zhaomei Mu and his associates concluded that the knockdown gene for Ezh2 inhibited both the migration and invasion of IBC cells.

== Geography ==
Man Uk Pin is located in the north-eastern New Territories of Hong Kong, on the north-western side of Sha Tau Kok Road, close to Wo Hang.


== History ==
According to the 1688 Gazetteer of Xin'an County, only two villages were established in the modern day Sha Tau Kok area: Ma Tseuk Leng and Man Uk Pin. Both were small agricultural settlements. Wo Hang, although existing, was not recognized.Man Uk Pin was recorded as a Hakka village in the 1819 Gazetteer of Xin'an County. It was first settled in the late 17th century by the Man (萬) who came from Wuhua (五華) in Guangdong province. The Man later moved out of the village and stayed in Heung Yuen, Ping Che and Tong Fong nearby. The village was later settled by the Chung (鍾) and the Fu (傅) in the 18th century and later by the Tong (唐), the Law (羅), the Chan (陳) and others. The Tong came to the village around the 19th century from Pingshan (坪山) in Guangdong.


== Features ==
Out of the eight ancestral halls that were built in the village, four are still standing today. One of them, the Tong Ancestral Hall, has been listed as a Grade III historic building.

Moving average crossover,"['All articles needing additional references', 'Articles needing additional references from September 2014', 'Technical indicators', 'Time series']","In the statistics of time series, and in particular the stock market technical analysis, a moving-average crossover occurs when, on plotting two moving averages each based on different degrees of smoothing, the traces of these moving averages cross. It does not predict future direction but shows trends. This indicator uses two (or more) moving averages, a slower moving average and a faster moving average. The faster moving average is a short term moving average. For end-of-day stock markets, for example, it may be 5-, 10- or 25-day period while the slower moving average is medium or long term moving average (e.g. 50-, 100- or 200-day period). A short term moving average is faster because it only considers prices over short period of time and is thus more reactive to daily price changes. On the other hand, a long term moving average is deemed slower as it encapsulates prices over a longer period and is more lethargic. However, it tends to smooth out price noises which are often reflected in short term moving averages.
A moving average, as a line by itself, is often overlaid in price charts to indicate price trends. A crossover occurs when a faster moving average (i.e., a shorter period moving average) crosses a slower moving average (i.e. a longer period moving average). In other words, this is when the shorter period moving average line crosses a longer period moving average line. In stock investing, this meeting point is used either to enter (buy or sell) or exit (sell or buy) the market.

Kiten was founded in 1931 by 30 families of Bulgarian refugees from Eastern Thrace who resettled there from the newly founded refugee village of Fazanovo. However, the area has roots from antiquity, as amphoras from the 6th century BCE were found on the south beach (Urdoviza). Kiten was declared a national resort in 1962, and since 1981 it had been administratively a quarter of nearby Primorsko. On 17 June 2005 the former village was proclaimed a separate town in order to more effectively cope with the growing number of tourists, primarily from Bulgaria, Romania, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Serbia, Russia and Germany.


== Geography ==
The town of Kiten is located in the southeastern part of the Republic of Bulgaria, on the Black Sea coast, 53 km southeast of the regional center of Bourgas, 6 km south of the municipal center of Primorsko and 12 km northwest of the center of the neighboring municipality of Tsarevo. It is located north of the mouth of the Kitenska River, and part of it - on the small peninsula Urdoviza.
The main features of the relief in Kiten, which are of paramount importance for tourism, are the beaches and the two picturesque bays - Karaagach and Konnik, better known as Atliman. There are other beautiful small bays along the Strandzha coast (Sozopol, Kavatsite, Stomoplo), but each of them has its own conditions and charm. The combination of the forested branches of Strandzha and the sea contributes to this.
The beaches are perhaps the main natural resource that determines the development of Kiten as a resort and as a center for summer sea recreation. The town of Kiten has two sandy beaches with a total area of about 145,000 m2. The northern beach or ""Kiten-Atliman"" is located at the bottom of the bay of the same name. It has an area of about 81,000 m2, which includes beautiful sand dunes. On both sides the beach is surrounded by a high rocky shore. The southern beach is conditionally divided into two - ""Kiten-South"" beach and ""Camping Kiten"" beach. It is located on the Gulf of Urdoviza, which is more open to the sea. The length of its coastline is 1380 m. To the south it reaches the mouth of the Karaagach River, and to the north to the beginning of the rocky Urdoviza peninsula, where the port quay is now built. Near Kiten are the beaches of MMC - ""Primorsko"" and ""Primorsko-South"", which are among the largest beaches on the Black Sea coast south of Bourgas.
Kiten has a mild, sunny, warm and humid transitional Mediterranean climate. The average annual temperature is 12 ° C and the average January temperature does not fall below 2 ° C. In Kiten there are no frosts typical for the interior of Strandzha in winter. The average daily temperature in summer is 27 ° C, and it is warm with about 1700 hours of sunshine from May to October. The prevailing winds are northwest, as well as breeze circulation during the warm half of the year. The good climatic conditions, combined with the peculiarities of the relief - the closed bays, suggest a calm sea during most of the summer season. Unfavorable are the strong rain and thunderstorms at the end of the summer season, usually in late August and September. The resort is located on the Black Sea coast, which is in itself a closed sea - its only connection to the World Ocean is the Bosphorus Strait, which connects it to the Sea of Marmara. This determines its low salinity, which is due to the large European rivers Danube, Dnieper, Dniester and Don flowing into it. The 18 per mille salinity distinguishes the Black Sea from all other seas, as well as the weak tides and the lack of dangerous marine life. These conditions provide excellent prerequisites for the development of summer sea tourism on the shores of this water basin, as well as other recreational activities such as water sports, fishing, etc.
Kiten is located on a small peninsula between the two small Black Sea bays Karaagach and Konnik (the latter is the southernmost part of the Devil's Bay). The rivers Karaagach, or also called Kitenska river, and Dyavolska river flow into them, respectively. In both rivers there are river and swamp mullet, black barbel, white fish. There is also a mineral spring in the resort, which is located near the Atliman campsite. The water comes from a depth of about 700 m. It is canalized and has an established chemical composition (nitrates, chlorides - 277 mg / dm3). The water of this spring is used mainly for drinking.
The main plant species that create the appearance and among which is located a large part of the resort are the various species of oak, such as hornbeam, sessile oak, cer, and artificial plantations of white and black pine. Dogwood is also found, and mainly around Karaagach Bay there is significant poplar afforestation. The mouth of the Kitenska River is overgrown with swamp reeds, willow, and along the steep cliff to the South Beach there is a wild vine. From the Strandzha vegetation there are certain species of plants, the growth of which is determined by the climatic influences of the sea tropics, such as the bushy subtropical plant Filirea media, called ""parnar"", the beautiful evergreen plant Rhododendron ponticum, known as Strandzha periwinkle and others.

In 2006 the remains of a Roman villa were discovered on land in Abermagwr from aerial photography, and the site was excavated in 2010 and 2011, with a final season undertaken in July 2015 to investigate the courtyard west of the villa. Until the discovery of the Roman villa in Abermagwr it was believed by archaeologists that Ceredigion was a military zone, unsettled by the Romano-British. The Roman villa is the first and only one of its kind discovered in Ceredigion and is the most remote Roman villa in Wales. It was home to Ceredigion's earliest slated roof, parts of which are on display along with excavated finds in the Ceredigion Museum, Aberystwyth. An ornate Roman cut glass vessel from the Rheinland, found in the rear room of the villa, is unique in Wales.

Sacy (grape),"[""Articles with 'species' microformats"", 'Articles with French-language sources (fr)', 'Articles with short description', 'Short description matches Wikidata', 'White wine grape varieties']","Sacy is a white wine grape grown primarily in the central and northeastern France within the Yonne and Allier départments.Sacy ripens early, and produces light-coloured wines low in acid and alcohol.","Sacy is a white wine grape grown primarily in the central and northeastern France within the Yonne and Allier départments.Sacy ripens early, and produces light-coloured wines low in acid and alcohol.


== Parentage ==
DNA typing has revealed Sacy to be a cross between Pinot and Gouais blanc. The DNA typing does not allow the identification of which Pinot variety (such as Pinot noir or Pinot gris) that was the parent. Sacy is one of a large number of French grape varieties sharing this parentage. This finding calls into question the older assumption that the grape variety would have originated in Italy, although it does not completely rule it out.


== History ==
The grape's origins have been assumed to be Italy, where it is supposed to have been brought to Burgundy some time in the thirteenth century by monks of the Reigny Abbey. The vine's high yields and productivity made it a popular plant that soon led to overproduction in neighboring areas. In 1732, the Parliaments of nearby Besançon and Vermonton banned any additional plantings. The grape continued to be produced in the Yonne department where it was used as a blending component in Crémant de Bourgogne wines from Auxerrois and as a blending partner with Aligoté and, to a lesser extent, Chardonnay.


== Regions ==
In the northern Rhône Valley and in the Auvergne region, the grape is known as Tresallier and is often blended with Sauvignon blanc to form a tart white wine. Today, Saint-Pourçain in the upper Loire Valley is the only French appellation to include Sacy in its blend. In Saint-Pourçain, blending of Sacy and Chardonnay is mandatory, and some Sauvignon blanc may also be included.


== Synonyms ==
Sacy is known under the following synonyms: Aligoté vert, Blanc de Pays, Blanc Moulin, Blanc vert, Fairené, Farié, Farinier blanc, Ferné, Fernet, Ferney, Gros blanc, Menu blanc, Peut blanc, Pivoine, Plant d'Essert, Plant de Sacy, Sassy, Souche, Terzari, Tres Sailier, Tresalier, Tresallier, Tressaillier, Tressalier, Tressallier, Trezaguier, Trezailhi, Trezali, Trezari, and Weissklemmer.

It is located in Hingham, Massachusetts, on the Weymouth Back River across from Great Esker Park.


== History ==

Until 1906, the land now established as Bare Cove Park was privately owned. The U.S. Navy then established the Hingham Naval Ammunition Depot, also known as Hockley Hollow at the time, because of its close proximity to Boston Harbor. The depot stored munitions for aircraft and ships until it was decommissioned in 1961, and the land was given to the towns of Hingham and Weymouth in the early seventies. Hingham's portion of the land was transformed into Bare Cove Park and opened its gates to the public in 1974. The town of Weymouth created Great Esker Park with their land. 


== Park features ==
Bare Cove Park Features multiple paved paths and trails that are often used for walking, jogging, and biking. The park consists of acres of woods, marshes, wetlands, fields, and river shoreline and is also scattered with retired naval bunkers. Many of the bunkers which have been demolished since the depot was decommissioned, leaving wide and open fields in their place.  


=== Dog walking ===
Bare Cove Park is very popular for dog walkers. Dogs must be leashed unless the dog owner has an Off-Leash Dog Walking Permit for the park. There is signage around the park designating where dogs may be off-leash.


== Wildlife ==
The park provides a sanctuary for diverse wildlife including minks, foxes, raccoons, and rabbits. Birds, including ospreys, double-crested cormorants, snowy egrets, and great blue herons, are seen significantly more by park-goers.

Although still assaultive at times, The Visitors developed a warmer, expansive sound, with lush atmospherics and harmonic complexity. A third album followed in the form of a collaboration with Nurse With Wound, called Paraparaparallelogrammatica (2004). Cyclobe took their ‘remix’ of a 40-minute Nurse With Wound composition to the extreme, mostly obliterating the original. With contributions from David Tibet of Current 93, and Coil members/collaborators Thighpaulsandra and Cliff Stapleton, the result was complex electroacoustic psychedelia, completely individual but very much in sympathy with Nurse With Wound's methods.Ossian Brown played on the Current 93 album ""Aleph at Hallucinatory Mountain"" (2009). Stephen Thrower recorded ""The Temporal Bends"", a CD that was released in collaboration with David Knight under the name UnicaZürn, featuring a rare performance from the artist and musician Danielle Dax.
In 2010 Cyclobe released the full-length album ""Wounded Galaxies Tap at The Window"" on Phantomcode records. On this album Ossian Brown and Stephen Thrower worked with guest musicians Thighpaulsandra, Cliff Stapleton, Michael J York and John Contreras. The albums centre piece being the 17 minute epic ""The Woods are Alive with The Smell of His Coming"", a track that was premiered at the Tate Gallery in St Ives. at the exhibition ""The Dark Monarch - Magic and Modernity in Modern Art"". The front cover artwork to ""Wounded Galaxies"" was created by the American artist Fred Tomaselli and the insert artwork by the artist Alex Rose. Alex Rose went on to create the front cover artwork for Cyclobe’s ""The Eclipser/The Moths of Pre-Sleep"" single which was also released that same year on Dot Dot Dot Music.
Ossian Brown's first book ""Haunted Air"" was published in 2010 by Jonathan Cape, with an introduction by David Lynch and an afterword by Geoff Cox.
In 2012 Cyclobe released ""Sulphur-Tarot-Garden"", soundtracks to three films by the film maker and artist Derek Jarman. This release was a limited edition CD to celebrate their debut live appearance in London at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, which also saw the premiere of these three films with Cyclobe's soundtrack.

Cyclobe's first live performance was held in Krems, Austria in April 2007 at the Donau Festival, curated by David Tibet from Current 93. Cyclobe's line up for this show was Ossian Brown, Stephen Thrower, Cliff Stapleton and Thighpaulsandra.

He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1987 to 2016. He was a Senator from 1983 to 1987, after being nominated by the Taoiseach.Deenihan played Gaelic football for the Kerry county team in the 1970s and 1980s. He also played rugby with Garryowen.


== Early and private life ==
Deenihan was born in Finuge, Lixnaw, County Kerry, in 1952. He was educated at St Michael's College, Listowel and later at the Thomond College of Education in Limerick. He also spent time in college in the UK. He is married to Mary, daughter of former Kerry footballer John Dowling, who is a teacher of history and economics in Mercy Secondary School, Mounthawk.


== Football career ==


=== Club ===
Deenihan had much success at club and divisional level with his local teams. At under-age level he won an under-14 North Kerry Championship with Finuge in 1963. Five years later in 1968, he won an under-16 North Kerry Championship with the Listowel Emmet's club. He also played with the St Senan's club at minor level. With Finuge Deenihan also won a North Kerry Senior League title in 1970, as well as a North Kerry Senior Championship title in 1987. With his local divisional team, Feale Rangers, he won two senior county championship medals in 1978 and 1980. While in college at St Mary's University, Twickenham in London he played with the Kingdom club and won a London Senior Football Championship.


=== Inter-county ===
By the late 1960s, Deenihan was a key part of Kerry's inter-county set-up and was playing on the county's minor team. In 1970, he won a Munster minor medal, however, he never won an All-Ireland medal. Deenihan later moved on to the county's under-21 team, where he won back-to-back Munster titles in 1972 and 1973, as well as an All-Ireland title in 1973.
By this stage, Deenihan was also a member of the Kerry senior football team. He won his first National Football League medal in 1973, however, Cork were the kingpins in the Munster Championship. Two years later in 1975, Deenihan captured his first Munster Championship and All-Ireland medals at senior level, under the new management of the legendary Mick O'Dwyer. It was the beginning of a glorious era for Kerry football and Deenihan played a key role in orchestrating much of the success.
In 1976, Deenihan won his second Munster title, however, Dublin gained revenge for the previous year by defeating Kerry in the All-Ireland final. 1977 was another frustrating year as Kerry won another set of National league and Munster titles but lost out to Dublin yet again, this time in the All-Ireland semi-final. By 1978, Kerry were ready for success. They easily won another Munster title and breezed into the All-Ireland final to face Dublin. The game itself is remembered for Mikey Sheehy's cheeky goal which he scored by lobbing the ball over the head of Paddy Cullen. The final score was 5–11 to 0–9 and Deenihan had finally secured a second All-Ireland medal. In 1979, Deenihan captured a fifth provincial title before later capturing a third All-Ireland medal following another emphatic victory over Dublin.
In 1980, Kerry breezed through the Munster Championship once again and later defeated Roscommon to win a third consecutive All-Ireland title. In 1981, Deenihan was appointed captain of the Kerry senior football team. It was a very special year as he collected his seventh consecutive Munster Championship medal before later leading Kerry out in a fourth All-Ireland final appearance. On the day the men from 'the Kingdom' easily defeated Offaly to give Deenihan his fifth All-Ireland medal. He rounded off the year by being presented with an All-Star award. At the start of 1982 Deenihan won a third National League medal when he captained Kerry to victory over Cork. Later that summer he broke his leg in training. He remained out of the game for eight months, meaning the injury effectively ended his inter-county career. Deenihan's last appearance in a Kerry jersey was in May 1983 when he played a challenge game at the opening of the Tarbert GAA field.
Deenihan also won Railway Cup medals with Munster in 1975, 1976, 1978, 1981 and 1982.


== Political career ==


=== Seanad and Dáil Éireann ===
As Deenihan's inter-county football career was drawing to a close, his political career was just beginning. He unsuccessfully contested Kerry North at the November 1982 general election. Then, shortly after his retirement in 1983, he was appointed to Seanad Éireann as a nominee of Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald. Deenihan later became involved in local politics as a member of Kerry County Council. He was elected to Dáil Éireann for the first time at the 1987 general election, for Kerry North, and was re-elected there at the six subsequent general elections.
Deenihan held a number of front bench portfolios for Fine Gael, including Youth and Sport (1988–1992) and Tourism and Trade (1992–1994) while Fine Gael were in opposition. In 1994 Fine Gael came to office without a general election, and on 20 December 1994 Deenihan was appointed by the Fine Gael–Labour–Democratic Left coalition government as Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry. In 1997, he became party spokesperson for the Office of Public Works. In the 2002 general election, which resulted in a near meltdown for Fine Gael, Deenihan saw his toughest election to date, being re-elected by a margin of almost 500 votes ahead of sitting TD Dick Spring. After the election of Enda Kenny as party leader he again received a Fine Gael front bench position as party spokesperson for Arts, Sport and Tourism. In the aftermath of the 2007 general election, he became party spokesperson on Defence, after being elected atop the poll in the Kerry North constituency with 12,697 votes. In July 2010, he was appointed as party spokesperson on Tourism, Culture and Sport.


=== Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht ===
At the 2011 general election, he was elected for the new constituency of Kerry North–West Limerick. On 9 March 2011, he was appointed a member of the Fine Gael–Labour government as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.In May 2011, he set out proposals to acquire from the Bank of Ireland the old Irish Parliament building in College Green for the state, to use as a cultural venue.In November 2011, he met with the stars of Titanic: Blood & Steel, while they were filming on location in Dublin.He was reported by the Irish Examiner as having announced the awarding of the title of City of Culture 2014 to Limerick in June 2012 without indicating the criteria for selection.


=== Minister of State for the Diaspora ===
On 11 July 2014, he was dropped as a cabinet minister in a reshuffle, and was appointed by the government as Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with responsibility for the Diaspora.His constituency was abolished at the 2016 general election; he stood for election in Kerry, but was not elected.

== Career ==
Nobles was a former carnival barker, bingo dealer, and announcer on several small Southern radio stations.  He became the first Euro-American disc jockey on radio to play popular African-American music regularly.  He started this practice before early rock-and-roll jockeys such as Alan Freed and before his fellow WLAC announcers ""John R."" Richbourg, Bill ""Hoss"" Allen, and Herman Grizzard.  The four WLAC announcers produced evening and late-night shows featuring R&B, soul music, and gospel music.  They attracted an audience of African-Americans and Euro-American teenagers well into the early 1970s.
Nobles is credited with introducing artists such as Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, and Little Richard, to a wider audience. Before Nobles' breakthrough programming, R&B artists were usually only heard by African-Americans, who attended their performances at nightclubs on the so-called Chitlin' Circuit and purchased their records in black-owned stores. Some conservative whites (especially segregationists) opposed the broadcast of such music, but many others purchased the R&B records and danced to them.In the early 1960s, Nobles drew complaints by listeners and FCC officials over a suggestive reference made while he read a commercial for White Rose Petroleum Jelly. Nobles regularly used double entendres between the records he played to accentuate his ironic, sarcastic sense of humor.
Nobles battled arthritis most of his adult life.  When he had to take time off, Bill ""Hoss"" Allen often filled in for him.  By the mid-1960s, Nobles, like the other disc jockeys, began to tape his programs to air in the evening time slots.  He continued to do this until his retirement, which varying sources have placed between 1972 and 1974.
Nobles had a long association with Randy Wood, founder of Dot Records, and Randy's Record Shop in nearby Gallatin, Tennessee. Wood later relocated to Los Angeles. Wood sponsored Nobles' program for many years.


== Personal life ==
Nobles was married to Eleanor Broadwater, who received a writing credit for the Dale Hawkins song ""Susie Q"", made popular in 1968 by Creedence Clearwater Revival.


== Famous phrases ==
Nobles developed slang phrases which he used frequently. Some of the more famous included:
""Jerks/fillies"" – boys/girls.
""From the heart of my bottom"" – a suggestive inversion of the traditional testimony to sincerity.
""That's G-A-double L-A-T-I-N, folks"" – spelling the name of the town where Randy's Record Shop was located

== The campaign ==


=== Syrian Army push into southern of the Raqqa Governorate ===
On 14 July 2017, the Syrian Army launched an offensive in the south of Raqqa province, advancing south of the town of Resafa and coming within 70 kilometers of Sukhnah after reaching the administrative border of Homs province. Between 15 and 16 July, a string of oil wells and gas fields was captured by the military. By 18 July, government forces pushed ISIL out of the western and southwestern parts of Raqqa province, while also reaching the outskirts of the Bishri Mountains, an ISIL stronghold.With the start of the Syrian Government's push, the Russian Air Force launched a large-scale aerial campaign against ISIL in Raqqa and Homs provinces. An ISIL command-and-control center in Deir ez-Zor, targets along the Homs-Deir ez-Zor highway and positions near Sukhnah were reportedly hit.Meanwhile, on 16 July, ISIL repelled an assault by the Syrian Army on the Hamimah area on the provincial border of Homs and Deir ez-Zor, killing a dozen soldiers and injuring or capturing 28 more. The captured soldiers were later reportedly decapitated. ISIL captured a tank and ammunition. Three days later, an ISIL raid on the administrative border overran an Army encampment before withdrawing. Concurrently, heavy fighting also erupted in Hama province. By 19 July, these clashes left 40 pro-government fighters, including two brigadier generals, and 29 militants dead.On 21 July, the Syrian Army advanced between 30 and 35 kilometers east of Resafa. Four days later, major advances by government forces in the southeast of Raqqa reduced ISIL's control of the province to 10 percent. At this point, the Army was nine kilometers from the administrative border of Deir ez-Zor province. The Army was also making gains along the western bank of the Euphrates river. By the end of the day, they were six kilometers from the town of Maadan, located on the southern bank of the river, and the Deir ez-Zor provincial border.


=== Syrian Army advance along the Euphrates and capture of Sukhnah ===
Meanwhile, on 23 July, the Syrian Army's 5th Corps in the eastern part of Homs province launched an operation towards Sukhnah and the next day reportedly broke through ISIL's defense line before the town. On 25 July, massive Army reinforcements were arriving east of Palmyra for the upcoming assault on Sukhnah, following the implementation of a Russia/US-brokered ceasefire with the rebel FSA in the southwestern Badia region, where government forces had been conducting a two-month campaign. At the same time, Syrian Army troops advanced west of the Shaer gas field in the eastern countryside of Homs.Elsewhere, on 25 July, the Syrian Army, backed up by Palestinian Al-Quds Brigade and local fighters, resumed their assault on the ISIL-held town of Qualib al-Thor in the eastern countryside of Hama Province. In the days before the resumption of Army operations in eastern Hama, the Russian Air Force conducted multiple strikes against ISIL.On 26 July, ISIL conducted a counterattack against Syrian Army troops in an attempt to maintain its foothold in Raqqa province and defend Maadan. In the evening of that day, the Syrian Army captured the last hills eight kilometers southwest of Sukhnah, imposing fire control over the town. Several hours later, the Syrian Army started its attack on Sukhnah, quickly reaching its outskirts after a seven-kilometer advance and entering it from the west and south, according to military sources. According to the pro-opposition activist group the SOHR, government forces were still five kilometers from the town.On 27 July, Syrian Army troops advanced to within four kilometers of Maadan, crossing the provincial boundary between Raqqa and Deir ez-Zor for the first time from the west.Two days later, ISIL militants conducted an early-dawn raid against Syrian Army positions in the western countryside of Raqqa, forcing the Army to retreat. Soon after, Syrian Army troops regrouped and launched a counter-attack, pushing back the ISIL militants who withdrew with captured weapons and ammunition. Meanwhile, the Syrian Army entered the southwestern part of Sukhnah, while ISIL fighters started withdrawing from the town. Concurrently, the Syrian Army's Tiger Forces special unit redeployed from Raqqa province to eastern Hama for the upcoming offensive east of the town of Salamiyah. The same day, a large artillery bombardment of ISIL positions was conducted by Syrian Army and allied troops in the eastern Hama countryside in addition to airstrikes.Late on 29 July, ISIL conducted a counterattack against the Syrian Army near the towns of Ghan Al-‘Ali and Shinan, pushing them back and cutting off their supply line to Ghan Al-‘Ali, as well as trapping a number of soldiers. 43 soldiers were killed and 65 wounded during the ISIL assault which included more than 10 suicide-bombers. The following day, the Syrian Army and tribal fighters regrouped and conducted a successful counter-attack, freeing the troops that were cut off. They then proceeded to advance into Ghan Al-‘Ali, eventually capturing the town, as well as several villages to the west of it. Syrian journalist Khaled Al-Khatib, who was working for the Russia Today television network, was killed when his vehicle was struck by an ISIL anti-tank missile in eastern Homs. By 31 July, Syrian Army forces advanced deep into the desert, coming within 40 kilometers of Deir ez-Zor city.On 2 August, it was reported that the Syrian Army was only 700 meters from Sukhnah. The next day, after fierce street clashes, they had taken control of 20% of the town. Two days later, on 5 August, the Syrian Army took complete control of Sukhnah. A surprise ISIL raid near al-Tanf on 7 August led to the capture and subsequent execution of Mohsen Hojaji, an IRGC advisor. An image taken of Hojaji's last moments became iconic in Iran, and he became widely regarded as a nationally acclaimed ""martyr"" in the war against ISIL.


=== ISIL collapse and siege in Hama and Homs ===
On 9 August, as the Syrian Army advanced within four kilometers of Maadan in Raqqa province, ISIL conducted a large-scale assault in the east of Homs province near the strategic T-2 Pumping Station. Militants attacked Army positions in the Humaymah area, resulting in several hours of fierce fighting. The attack was eventually repelled, with the Army claiming more than 80 ISIL militants were killed, while they themselves lost 22 soldiers. In contrast, the SOHR reported the deaths of 32 Syrian Army soldiers and at least 35 ISIL militants. The ISIL attack took place on a 125 kilometer front.Following a night-time operation late on 11 August, Syrian Army paratroopers, who landed behind ISIL's lines, captured two towns and 12 kilometers of desert in the southeast of Raqqa province. 25 ISIL militants and six Army commandos were killed during the operation.Meanwhile, the Syrian government's Qalamoun Shield Forces, alongside the 5th Legion, also made a push towards ISIL's stronghold of Uqayribat in the eastern countryside of Hama, capturing several positions east of the village of Salba.On 16 August, the Syrian Army made a push north of Al-Shaer mountains, overrunning ISIL positions in almost half a dozen areas, as other units progressed southwards from Ithriya and captured several hilltops. The next day, the Syrian Army's Tiger Forces suspended an offensive in the southeast of Raqqa Governorate in order to focus their efforts on the eastern Hama and Homs countrysides. This effort resulted in a myriad of military units storming arid, mountainous and sparsely inhabited, but oil and gas-rich ISIL-held areas in Central Syria from multiple directions, and the capture of more than half a dozen locations, including several of the oil and gas fields. During the same day, the 800th Regiment of the Republican Guard advanced 15 km north of Al-Sukhnah, capturing a checkpoint. ISIL fighters were left completely encircled between 50 and 100 villages in eastern Hama and Homs governorates on 18 August, as one group of Syrian Army troops advanced north of Al-Shaer mountains eventually linking up with recently redeployed Tiger Forces which pushed southwards from Ithriya. A smaller ISIL enclave formed south of the Ithriya-Zakia highway.Elsewhere, Syrian Army forces captured southern and central parts of Humaymah village in the eastern Homs Province, after securing several hilltops near it the previous day. The village was completely secured on 21 August; however, ISIL launched a counter-attack on it hours later.Between 23 and 24 August, the Army made advances northwest and west of Al-Sukhnah, with forces advancing north of the town and those advancing from Raqqa linking up and thus besieging a second large ISIL pocket in central Syria. Two days later, the pocket was cleared with the Army capturing an area of 2,000 square kilometers (772 square miles) between Sukhnah and Sha'er to the west.


=== ISIL counterattacks ===
During the evening of 23 August, ISIL forces in the western pocket attacked the Ithriyah-Salamiyah road in order to cut the Syrian government's main supply line to Aleppo, capturing two checkpoints south of the road (one of which was subsequently retaken by the Syrian Army and the National Defence Forces). At the same time, the rebel group Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham alongside Free Syrian Army shelled the supply line from the north; according to al-Masdar News, the ISIL attack was coordinated with the rebel groups. The next day, ISIL forces launched a large-scale operation west of Maadan alongside the western bank of the Euphrates, capturing seven villages from the Syrian Army and allied tribal fighters. Overall, government forces were pushed back 30 kilometers from the western outskirts of Maadan.On 25 August, the Syrian Army stalled the ISIL assault against the Aleppo supply line and launched a counterattack, capturing three villages and putting themselves nine kilometers away from the ISIL stronghold at Uqayribat. The next day, the Tiger Forces troops also recaptured territory west of Maadan, but ISIL once again recaptured those same villages on 29 August.


=== Breaking of the siege of Deir ez-Zor city ===
On 27 August, the Syrian Army launched a major offensive along the Sukhna-Deir ez-Zor highway, advancing to positions 66 kilometers from Deir ez-Zor city by 29 August. On 31 August, the Syrian Army's Tiger Forces established full control over the strategic mountain of Bishiri, west of Deir ez-Zor. The offensive was accompanied by heavy Russian airstrikes on ISIL positions. They also captured the town of Haribshah. At this point, Syrian Army troops were 50 kilometers from Deir ez-Zor. By 2 September, the Syrian Army's Tiger Forces and 5th Corps alongside the Iran-backed Afghan Shia militia Liwa Fatemiyoun advanced from mount Bishiri towards Tal Al-Abd, Jabal Nazerat, Jabal Nairaman, and Jabal Admah, resulting in the capture of those hilltops and placing the Syrian Army within 25 km (16 mi) of lifting the siege imposed by ISIL for years on Deir ez-Zor city and within 16 km of village of al-Shulah, located southwest of the city. The next day, the Tiger Forces progressed further eastwards, coming within 18 km of Deir ez-Zor, capturing some minor hills in the desert and later in the day advancing towards al-Shulah and imposing fire control over the village from the north by securing Mount Neerman.By 4 September, Syrian Army troops were within three kilometers of Deir ez-Zor, as ISIL sent reinforcements from Mayadin. The 5th Corps alongside the 18th Reserve Division captured the town of Kabajib during midday and later in the day captured the town of al-Shulah alongside the Tiger Forces.The siege of the city was broken on 5 September 2017, at around 2 P.M. local time, when Syrian Army troops met the 137th Brigade on the western outskirts of the city.A second phase of Deir ez-Zor operation began on 5 September, with the Tiger Forces and the 17th Division troops pushing southwards from 137th Brigade Base towards Ayyash Storage. The stated goal of this offensive was to eventually capture the Thardeh Mountains (which had been captured by ISIL fighters after CJTF-OIR forces launched a prolonged assault upon then-besieged Syrian Army soldiers in September 2016) and thus lift the siege of the airport imposed by ISIL since then. Two days later, the Syrian Army reported they had captured a gas factory and the 'Raqqa Bridge' near 137th Brigade Base, thus closing in on Ayyash Storage area as well as few hilltops near Tal Sannouf which resulted in securing the supply route to western Deir ez-Zor. Al-Qassem Republican Guard soldiers reported they had captured the hilltop of Talat Alloush within the perimeter of Deir ez-Zor cemetery after intense clashes with ISIL fighters on 8 September.On 9 September, SANA reported that the Syrian Army had broken the siege of the airport and the city′s districts of Hrabesh and Tahtouh. Russia’s Defense Ministry said the lifting of the siege in the evening of 9 September had followed ″a massive air strike by the Russian Aerospace Forces″.


=== Syrian Army clears northwest Deir ez-Zor and southeast Raqqa ===

The Syrian Army launched an assault during the morning hours of 14 September After this, the Syrian Army was able to capture Maria'yah and secured its surroundings. After two days, the Syrian Army captured Ayyash and its nearby hill, reversing ISIL gains made during a previous offensive in 2016. The town of Jafrah, south of Deir ez-Zor was captured by the Syrian Army after days of clashes. Half a dozen towns were also captured the same day in the opposite direction from Deir ez-Zor, albeit with less fierce resistance from ISIL.By 23 September, Syrian Government forces advancing northwest of Deir ez-Zor linked up with troops in southeast Raqqa and managed to capture Maadan, Overall, between 14 and 23 September, the military cleared between 1,300 and 1,700 square kilometers of territory, including 35 towns and villages, and secured the western bank of the Euphrates River in the northwestern countryside of Deir ez-Zor.


=== Collapse of the ISIL pocket in central Syria ===
On 28 August, the Syrian Army continued its operations in central Syria, targeting ISIL's last positions in the western countryside of Jabal Al-Sha’er and captured several areas. The Syrian Army and its allies resumed their operations in the southeastern countryside of Hama on 29 August, attacking ISIL's positions from two different axes. The pro-government forces of Qalamoun Shield stormed the group's positions east of Salamiyah, resulting in capture of al-Taybah. Following this, the Syrian Army advanced to southeast of Salamiyah and captured several hilltops in Abu Hakfeh area. By 31 August, they captured six settlements including 3 both to northeast and southeast of Uqayribat. They also captured the key al-Wahabiyah village in central Homs.By 31 August, the Syrian Army and its allies had come within striking distance of Uqayribat. SOHR stated that Syrian Army captured Uqayribat on 1 September but ISIL regained control of most of the town after a counter-attack on the next day. The ISIL militants were however pushed out of the town again on the morning of 3 September with the help of artillery and airstrikes. SOHR stated that over 120 ISIL fighters and 35 pro-government fighters had died in 24 hours of clashes. Meanwhile, the Syrian Army also killed Abu Saraqah Al-Trablosi, a high-ranking Lebanese commander of ISIL. It also captured Mu’adamiyah and Al-Khafiyah in the eastern countryside of Uqayribat.By 4 September, the Syrian Army captured the main ISIL base in the region near the town of Tahmaz in the east of Hama, while also securing two other towns west of Uqayribat. On 6 September, government forces captured half a dozen more villages. Villages of Zaghroutiyah, Drawayshiyah, Lawaybdah, Ghaniman, and Umm Sajj within eastern Homs governorate were captured on 13 September by Syrian Army alongside National Defense Forces and Hezbollah.Later in September, the Thermal Power Plant was captured by Qalamoun Shield forces of 3rd Division, just 1 km away from village of Qulib al-Thor. The village itself was captured on 14 September. The next day ISIL forces launched an offensive in Jubb al-Jarrah district, overrunning Syrian Army positions and capturing the village of Abu Al-Tababir. On 16 September, rebels of Faylaq al-Majd stormed Syrian Army positions in northern Hama governorate, but failed to make any gains. During the same day Qalamoun Shield soldiers together with the National Defence Forces and Syrian Social Nationalist Party's armed wing took hold of hilltop Tal Al-Noba, along with the settlements of Al-Khalaya, Al-Mashrafah, and Khaled Hilal, later in the day entering the village of Abu Hanaya, resulting in capture of three quarters of it. 5th Legion soldiers captured the villages of Al-Mazbel and Masadeh, located within eastern Homs Governorate, on 21 September. On 22 September, the town of Mushayrifah Al-Shamaliyah was captured by the Syrian Army after a short firefight. All combat activities in eastern Hama and Homs governorates have concluded on 6 October resulting in Army's capture of remaining 1,800 km2 and erasing the pocket.


=== ISIL counteroffensive ===
On 28 September, ISIL launched its own counteroffensive, capturing the city of al-Qaryatayn in the Homs desert by 1 October. Fighting in the region left 569 killed between 28 September and 12 October, including 271 pro-government troops and 298 ISIL fighters. The Syrian Army recaptured al-Qaryatayn on 21 October. Bodies of 67 Syrian civilians who were summarily killed by ISIL, were found after Syrian forces captured the town. Some were shot as the militants retreated because they were suspected of collaborating with the government, per activists. A senior official said search and documentation of those killed was still underway and the toll was likely to climb. SOHR said 128 people were killed, including 12 by pro-government forces.


== Aftermath: advance on Al-Mayadin ==

Government forces steadily advanced in Deir ez-Zor governorate in the beginning of October, putting them within 6 km from ISIL's stronghold of Al-Mayadin. Syrian soldiers pushed into the city on 6 October. On 13 October, Government forces reached the Euphrates on the Eastern side of the Mayadin, besieging the town. On 14 October, the city was captured by the Syrian Army.

== Fictional character biography ==
Jason Strongbow is a member of the Navajo Nation who was born in Kaibito, Arizona. He attempted to stop a mining company from excavating a mountain sacred to his tribe. He discovered that the villain Klaw was in league with the mining company. Klaw needed uranium to augment his sonic powers. Strongbow's brother Ward did not agree with him about preserving the mountain. Inside the mine, an argument erupted between the brothers and Klaw which led to violence. During the fight, Klaw used his sonic blaster on the two brothers. Somehow, a combination of the sonic energy of the blast and the exposure to the uranium gave both of the Strongbow brothers enhanced physical abilities. Klaw fled with his crew and Ward to the Savage Land in hopes of gaining vibranium to augment his powers.Jason emerged from the mine. Taking inspiration from a flying eagle, he took up the mantle of American Eagle. He followed Klaw to the Savage Land. There, he met Ka-Zar, Thing, and Wyatt Wingfoot. The four joined forces and defeated Klaw and his minions. During the battle, Ward was shot and killed by one of the miners.American Eagle returned to become a champion of his tribe, subsequently identified as the Navajo Nation. Since his battle with Klaw in the Savage Land, he was among the heroes of the world gathered to take part in the Contest of Champions, he was among the heroes who gathered to honor the Hulk, and he was among the heroes who helped Rom the Spaceknight defeat the Dire Wraiths.In his first solo adventure, the American Eagle defeated the Peace Monger and his Knights of Saint Virgil in Washington, D.C. With the NYPD, American Eagle arrests his cousin Jimmy Littlehawk who - along with two friends - robbed a casino on the Reservation then left for New York City. He helped F.B.I. agent Dale Peck arrest Jonas Murphy, a mutant and a serial killer. With Detective Frank Ramirez, Strongbow stopped a drug ring led by a man named Sinner, who used children to sell his merchandise. Strongbow escaped execution by John Marshall, who stole land from Native Americans man and was later ruined through a real estate charge by American Eagle. With the help of Interpol, Strongbow lured Marshall and his soldiers into a trap.After the 2006 ""Civil War"" storyline, Jason Strongbow confirms to his friend Steve Rogers that he is strongly against the Super-Human Registration Act, and is planning to fight Iron Man over it. He also bears a new costume with fewer stereotypically Native American attributes, including a leather jacket and a helmet resembling the head and beak of a bald eagle. It is his intent to prevent the Steel Spider from direct confrontation with an angry group of men from Jason's Navajo reservation by persuading the Steel Spider to ease up on his zealous vigilante act. By talking to Ollie, he hopes to defuse a time bomb of local violence just waiting to explode.
The Eagle finds the Steel Spider in downtown Phoenix, Arizona, as the Thunderbolts unexpectedly arrive. Ollie argues that they will try to kill him and replace him with ""Some Good Government Worker"". When the Thunderbolts eventually do emerge, Jason decides to ally himself with Steel Spider, shooting the team's leader, Moonstone, through the wrist with a crossbow bolt. After a prolonged fight, Sepulchre becomes involved, and the three defeat Venom, the Swordsman, Songbird, and Radioactive Man. Though the latter two wish to try to defeat them using the old team's methods, leaving Sepulchre and the Eagle, Moonstone orders that Bullseye cripple the Eagle in the same way he did Jack Flag. The issue ends with Songbird, Radioactive Man, Penance and Venom squaring up against Steel Spider, Sepulchre and Jason, in what Steel Spider describes as 'almost ... a fair fight'. The Eagle ends up crippling Bullseye before making his escape.A news reporter stated that because American Eagle lives on a Native American Reservation he is exempt from the Registration Act, and that the Commission on Superhuman Activities would take no action against him because of this.During the 2008-09 ""Dark Reign"" storyline, it is revealed that Jason is hiding James Rhodes' mother inside the Navajo County. Norman Osborn later tries to convince him to subdue War Machine, besides he has no jurisdiction over Strongbow. Jason refuses to act for anyone other than the interests of the Navajo and fights together with War Machine against a ""Giant Ultimo Head"" Rhodes stumbled upon along the way to find the men behind the ""Ultimo Virus"" deployed in Acquiria.During the 2011 ""Fear Itself"" storyline, American Eagle deals with the fear and chaos in Bleachville as well as drug traffickers and the town's mayor.American Eagle later appears as a member of the Agents of Wakanda.


== Powers, abilities and equipment ==
American Eagle possesses superhuman strength, enabling him to lift (press) approximately 15 tons under optimal conditions. He also possesses superhuman speed, agility, stamina, and sturdiness as a result of radiation-induced mutation. Strongbow's bodily tissues are somewhat harder and more resistant to physical injury than that of an ordinary human. However, he is far from invulnerable. While he can be injured by weapons composed of conventional materials, he can withstand impact forces that would severely injure or kill a normal human with little to no injury to show for it. He can run at a maximum speed of 65 miles per hour for approximately 5 hours before tiring to an appreciable degree.American Eagle's sensory organs have also been fortified by the radiation-induced mutation. Like his namesake, the Eagle, he has hyperkeen eyesight, able to see at 800 feet (240 m) what the average human being sees at 20 feet (6.1 m). His senses of hearing, smell, taste, and touch are approximately three times that of an average human being.He also carries a crossbow which fires special bolts.


== Analysis ==
In Native Americans in Comic Books - A Critical Study, Michael A. Sheyahshe notes that while American Eagle ""may have some inherent stereotypic issues, the fact that American Eagle's powers come from a non-ethnically based source (and not, say, the Great Spirit) marks a significant improvement for Indigenous characters.""During an interview with Comic Book Resources, the assistant editor Lauren Sankovitch explains why she chose to represent American Eagle in Marvel Assistant-Sized Spectacular #1 (2009):

For a character whose total appearances I could count on my fingers, not to mention having some of the worst costumes in the history of tacky superherowear, I felt American Eagle had such a tremendous potential within the Marvel U as a whole. With his strong identification to his Native American heritage and disaffected attitude towards the larger superhero community, he's a principled man with his own brand of justice. Pair that with his bone-dry sense of humor and take-all-comers power set, he is a force to be reckoned with.
In an interview, Greg Pak, the writer of the story ""Homeland"" in War Machine vol. 2 #6-7 (2010), told that Jason Strongbow, aka American Eagle, is easily his ""favorite reinvented character of the past decade."" Indeed, the modern character has undergone some transformations compared to its appearances from 1981 to 1994. At the beginning, the Navajo hero was wearing a stereotypical costume with feather headdress and buckskin boots. When the writer Warren Ellis and the artist Mike Deodato Jr. used the character in Thunderbolts, its new look is composed of ordinary clothes, a leather jacket and a helmet resembling the head and beak of a bald eagle. In its first appearances, Strongbow was running under his own power, at the opposite the new version uses a motorcycle.


== Other characters named American Eagle ==


=== World War II ===
There was an American Eagle before Strongbow took the mantle. Lt. Col. James Fletcher, a renowned battlefield hero of World War I in recent times became the security chief and trainer for Project: Rebirth. He was captured by agents of the Red Skull (Johann Schmidt) and was tortured by the Master Interrogator. He refused to yield any information and committed suicide to avoid breaking under further torture. First appeared in Adventures of Captain America #1 (September 1991) and appeared through to issue #3 (December 1991) which depicted his death.


=== Earth-712 ===

It remains in use with the Zimbabwe National Army.,"The MAP45 Armoured Personnel Carrier (a.k.a. MAP 'four five') is a Rhodesian/Zimbabwean 4x4d heavy troop-carrying vehicle (TCV) first introduced in 1978 based on a Mercedes-Benz truck chassis. It remains in use with the Zimbabwe National Army.


== History ==
The MAP45 Armoured Personnel Carrier ('MAP' stands for mine and ambush protected in Rhodesian military jargon) was developed in 1977-78 by the Rhodesian Army Workshops as a light version of the MAP75 TCV. Production started early in 1978 at Army Workshops but in order to meet the increasing demand, manufacture was contracted out to the Rhodesian private firm Zambesi Coachworks Ltd of Salisbury (now Harare).


== General description ==
The MAP45 consists of an all-welded body with a cut-down troop compartment built on a modified Mercedes-Benz 4.5 ton Series LA911B truck chassis.  Adapted from the MAP75 TCV, the open-topped hull or 'capsule' is faceted at the sides, which were designed to deflect small-arms' rounds, and a flat deck reinforced by a v-shaped 'crush box' meant to deflect mine blasts. Three inverted U-shaped low 'Roll bars' were fitted to protect the fighting compartment from being crushed in case the vehicle turned and roll over after a landmine detonation.  Due to the shortened top hull, their reduced height presented less of a problem since it did not hamper movements inside the troop compartment as in the MAP75.


=== Protection ===
The hull was made of ballistic 10mm mild steel plate; front windscreen and side windows had 40mm bullet-proof laminated glass.


=== Armament ===
Rhodesian MAP45s were usually armed with a FN MAG-58 7.62mm Light Machine Gun (LMG), sometimes installed on a locally produced one-man MG armoured turret to protect the gunner.  Vehicles assigned to convoy escorting duties ('E-type') had a Browning M1919A4 7.62mm medium machine gun mounted on an open-topped, cylinder-shaped turret (dubbed 'the dustbin').  For 'externals' twin Browning MG pintle mounts were sometimes fitted, placed behind the driver's compartment.  The Zimbabwean vehicles after 1980 sported single pintle-mounted Soviet-made 12.7mm and 14.5mm Heavy Machine Guns (HMG) instead.


== Variants ==
Troop-Carrying Vehicle (TCV) – is the standard IFV/APC version, armed with either a single LMG (Rhodesian SF 1978-79) or HMG (ZNA 1980-present) and capable of carrying 12 infantrymen.
Convoy escorting version – designated 'E-type', this is a basic IFV/APC version fitted with the Browning MG 'dustbin' turret.
Command vehicle – command version equipped with radios and map boards.


== Combat history ==
The MAP45 TCV soon became a popular vehicle among the elite units of the Rhodesian Security Forces – including the Rhodesian African Rifles (RAR), the Rhodesian Light Infantry (RLI), and the Rhodesian SAS – who employed it late in the war on their cross-border covert raids ('externals') against ZIPRA and ZANLA guerrilla bases in the neighboring Countries, such as the September 1979 raid on the ZANLA's New Chimoio base in Mozambique (Operation ""Miracle"").After independence, the MAP45 entered service with the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) in early 1980 and participated in the large military exercises conducted at Somabula Plain, Matabeleland that same year.  ZNA's 'Four Fives' were thrown into action in November 1980 against ZIPRA troops at the 1st Battle of Entumbane and later at the February 1981 2nd Battle of Entumbane (near Bulawayo, Matabeleland), and later again after February 1982 by helping to put down the Super-ZAPU insurgency in Matabeleland.  The converted MAP45 TCVs were also employed by the ZNA forces in Mozambique during the Mozambican Civil War, guarding the Mutare-Beira oil pipeline from 1982 to 1993. The MAP45 later served with the ZNA contingent sent to the Democratic Republic of Congo during the Second Congo War from 1998 to 2002.


== Operators ==
 Rhodesia – some 200 or 300 vehicles in service with the Rhodesian Security Forces in 1978-1980 passed on to successor state.
 Zimbabwe – Still in service with the ZNA.

== Biography ==
Schwartz was born and raised in Halifax, Nova Scotia, graduating from the Halifax Grammar School in 1987, then moving to Montreal to study at the National Theatre School in 1987. He was accepted to the acting, technical theatre and directing sections of the conservatory, graduating from Technical Production in 1990 and from the Directing Section in 1992. After an internship year in Ireland and Northern Ireland, he returned to NS to start Two Planks and a Passion Theatre with his wife, Chris O'Neill. They settled in the Annapolis Valley and have three children.


== Early career ==
Schwartz began acting in High School, from which he took a short leave in his senior year to be on the professional stage at Neptune Theatre in a production of Tartuffe directed by Richard Ouzounian.
After graduation from the National Theatre School, he and his wife spent a year interning with theatre companies in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. He watched directors like Paul Mercier, who wrote and directed the Passion Machine's Studs, Charabanc Theatre's Bondagers and was an intern under playwright and director Frank McGuinness for the Druid Company's production of Carthaginians about Bloody Sunday in Derry, which was hailed by critics and which toured to Derry. The choice of Ireland was deliberate because of its similarity to Nova Scotia. It too had a largely rural population with one large city and he chose to work with companies which were creating their own text-based work, often borne of important events in their history and touring it, because of his and his partner's vision for a new theatre in Nova Scotia.
In 1992 they returned to Nova Scotia after a five-year absence and settled in Sheffield Mills, a hamlet close to Wolfville, surrounded by fields and farms. Using the Sheffield Mills community hall for their rehearsal base, Schwartz and O'Neill incorporated Two Planks and a Passion Theatre Association as a non-profit within the province of Nova Scotia.


== Two Planks and a Passion Theatre ==
Two Planks and a Passion Theatre was initially founded and dedicated to touring new Canadian Plays with strong roles for women throughout Nova Scotia and Canada with a focus on rural communities. Schwartz and O'Neill were particularly interested in using Nova Scotian history and events to create new drama, ""a theatre rooted in emotional realism and community experience"". The first production was a Nova Scotian premiere of Daniel MacIvor's See Bob Run, a one-woman show starring O'Neill and directed by Schwartz. It began at the Atlantic Fringe Festival then toured to Wolfville. The company continued to develop its touring activity with other Nova Scotian premieres such as Linda Griffiths The Darling Family which was their first tour outside of NS, to Charlottetown PEI. Schwartz and O'Neill continued to work toward developing new productions and in 1993 created The Butterbox Babies, based on the best-selling book by Bette Cahill.When Schwartz and O'Neill resettled in Nova Scotia, there was major news of a coal mining disaster at the Westray Mine in Pictou County, NS. People from across the province and the country were caught up in the struggle to rescue and then recover the miners and the subsequent political scandal. Schwartz and O'Neill soon purchased the rights to journalist Dean Jobb's book which gave them access to hours of tapes of interviews with mine managers, miners, draegermen and mine families. The resulting production was the company's most extensive tour, in part supported by the United Steelworkers of America. The show opened in the mining community, next door to the courthouse where mine managers were concurrently on trial for their role in the disaster. From there it went on to play performing arts centres, schools and mining communities.Schwartz continued to direct all the productions for Two Planks and a Passion Theatre with the exception of their first production of Mike Melski's Hockey Mom, Hockey Dad, and Pegalie in 2006, for which he was producer only. He and O'Neill wrote two more shows for the company before he switched focus and took the company from a purely touring production company to one based solidly at the Ross Creek Centre for the Arts. In 2007 he directed Rick Chafe's The Odyssey, a Canadian adaptation of the classic story  by Homer. In Schwartz's interpretation, the show was presented by shipwrecked crew from Nova Scotia's past and the show garnered many award nominations along with critical and audience success. this became the first of the Theatre off the Grid series which has become the cornerstone of the Schwartz' work.
In 2008 he directed two productions at Ross Creek: Our Town by Thortnon Wilder and Jerome: The Historical Spectacle, which he commissioned from Ami McKay, author of The Birth House.
In 2008 he was nominated for Best Director at the NS professional theatre Awards  (The Merritt Awards) and in 2009 he won that award for his direction of Our Town while also winning Outstanding Production for that show. In 2009 he was also awarded the Established award by the NS Government and in 2002, Schwartz received the Queen's Golden Jubilee Medal for his service to the community. In 2010 Schwartz's production of Rockbound, a musical written by Allen Cole and based on the novel by Frank Parker Day was nominated for 7 professional theatre Awards, and took home 5 Merritt Awards, including Best New Play, Best Musical Score, Best Director for Ken Schwartz, and Best Production.
In 2010, Schwartz directed an Off the Grid outdoor production of Arthur Miller's The Crucible.
In 2011, his Off the Grid Production was the world premiere of Winnipeg Playwright Rick Chafe's Beowulf, which Schwartz had commissioned for the theatre.
In 2012, he adapted Aristophenes' classic Lysistrata, creating an American Civil War setting for the tale of women stopping a war through a sex strike. He collaborated with Allen Cole, who wrote the Music and Lyrics in the adaptation.
In 2013 he directed As You Like It by William Shakespeare and his own adaptation of Homer's Iliad told around a campfire.


== Other Work ==
In 2010 Schwartz was accepted to the Michael Langham Workshop for Classical Text at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Ontario and took a sabbatical from Two Planks to complete this program, which included assistant directing J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan under British director Tim Carroll. In 2013 he returned to Stratford for a second workshop, this time assisting Tim Carroll on Romeo and Juliet.
In 2013 he directed Six Characters in Search of an Author by Luigi Pirandello for the Dalhousie Theatre Department, and narrated the readings for the Kings College Chapel Choir Annual Christmas tour, under Paul Halley's direction.


== Writing ==
Schwartz has been a writer throughout his career, both of plays and articles. His most recent work was an adaptation in Iambic pentameter of Homer's Iliad, and in 2012, he adapted the Greek classic comedy Lysistrata as a musical (lyrics and music by Allen Cole) set in the American South during the Civil War.
His play (co-written with Chris O'Neill) of Westray: the Long Way Home, was published in 1995 and then republished by Talonbooks in the early 21st century.He and O'Neill contributed an article to the Canadian Theatre Review about their unique partnership with the United Steelworkers of America to produce the Westray show and tour it throughout Canada. His writing on touring theatre in Canada ""The Long and Winding Road: Touring Canada with Two Planks and a Passion Theatre"", was included in the Canadian Theatre Review's summer 2005 issue on working conditions in Canadian Theatre and his writing on the demolition of the NS Arts Council, ""A Principle in Exile: The Elimination of the Nova Scotia Arts Council"", was included in Fuse Magazine in August 2002. He also acts as dramaturg for the new works in development at Two Planks and a Passion Theatre.


== Advocacy ==
Schwartz was involved in arts advocacy both on a personal and organizational level from the beginning of his Nova Scotian career. He was on the founding board of the Nova Scotia Professional Theatre Alliance (now Theatre Nova Scotia) and has continued to support that organization as a board, panel and jury member since 1995.
In the late 1990s, Schwartz was nominated to the newly formed arms length Nova Scotian Arts Council, a group legislated by the province to distribute funds to artists through peer juries. He served on the founding board of the Council for three years.
In 2002, the Province of Nova Scotia, under Minister of Tourism and Culture Rodney MacDonald closed the Arts Council unilaterally, locking the doors and firing almost all staff. The arts community reacted strongly and Schwartz was elected chair of the resulting ""Save our Arts Council campaign"" which included his debating the minister on television. The Council was not reinstated.
Schwartz has continued to be active in arts advocacy, participating in a national arts lobbying effort to members of the Canadian Parliament and serving on the provincial government's Arts and Culture Partnership Council. He has served on the board of the Professional Association of Canadian Theatres among other organizations.


== Arts Community ==
Part of Schwartz and O'Neill's vision when they began the touring theatre company was to have a separate but connected organization which would bring national and international artists to their rural Nova Scotian Community and create a centre for arts education, creation and development - a rural laboratory for all the arts. In 2000 the association purchased a 186-acre (0.75 km2) farm on the Annapolis Valley's North Mountain and added the Ross Creek Centre for the Arts to their bailiwick. While he serves as CEO of CoastArts, the larger umbrella organization that was created to govern both the Ross Creek Centre and Two Planks and a Passion Theatre, his daily responsibilities currently focus primarily on the Theatre Company.

== Maintenance ==

Prior to the creation of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) in 2009, the route was owned and maintained by the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR, previously the Metropolitan District Commission). On November 1, 2009, the Msgr. William Casey Highway overpass in Jamaica Plain, Morton Street in Mattapan and Gallivan Boulevard in Dorchester were transferred to MassDOT, while the Arborway continues to be maintained under the DCR.


== History ==

Route 203 was designated in the early 1970s as part of a large Boston-area renumbering. Most of the route had been part of Route 3, which came south along the Jamaicaway with US 1 and split to the east onto the Arborway and along present Route 203. Route 3 turned south at Granite Avenue to join the Southeast Expressway in Milton, and Route 3A began southbound at the same location.
With the renumbering, Route 3 was rerouted onto the Southeast Expressway (I-93) into downtown, Route 3A was truncated to its current end in Neponset (although it is technically concurrent with Route 3 between Boston and Burlington), and the former alignment of Routes 3 and 3A were redesignated as Route 203. While the former routes had been signed north–south, the new route was signed east–west to better reflect its actual direction of travel.
In the 1980s, US 1 was removed from its surface alignment in Boston and instead cosigned with I-95 and I-93. As a result, Route 203 no longer terminates at a numbered route at its western end.


== Major intersections ==
The entire route is in Boston, Suffolk County.

It was built by Edward I, during his conquest of Wales, between 1283 and 1287. Constructed as part of a wider project to create the walled town of Conwy, the combined defences cost around £15,000, a huge sum for the period. Over the next few centuries, the castle played an important part in several wars. It withstood the siege of Madog ap Llywelyn in the winter of 1294–95, acted as a temporary haven for Richard II in 1399 and was held for several months by forces loyal to Owain Glyndŵr in 1401.
Following the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642, the castle was held by forces loyal to Charles I, holding out until 1646 when it surrendered to the Parliamentary armies. In the aftermath, the castle was partially slighted by Parliament to prevent it being used in any further revolt, and was finally completely ruined in 1665 when its remaining iron and lead was stripped and sold off. Conwy Castle became an attractive destination for painters in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Visitor numbers grew and initial restoration work was carried out in the second half of the 19th century. In the 21st century, the ruined castle is managed by Cadw as a tourist attraction.
UNESCO considers Conwy to be one of ""the finest examples of late 13th century and early 14th century military architecture in Europe"", and it is classed as a World Heritage Site. The rectangular castle is built from local and imported stone and occupies a coastal ridge, originally overlooking an important crossing point over the River Conwy. Divided into an Inner and an Outer Ward, it is defended by eight large towers and two barbicans, with a postern gate leading down to the river, allowing the castle to be resupplied from the sea. It retains the earliest surviving stone machicolations in Britain and what historian Jeremy Ashbee has described as the ""best preserved suite of medieval private royal chambers in England and Wales"". In keeping with other Edwardian castles in North Wales, the architecture of Conwy has close links to that found in the Kingdom of Savoy during the same period, an influence probably derived from the Savoy origins of the main architect, James of Saint George.","Conwy Castle (Welsh: Castell Conwy; Welsh pronunciation: [kastɛɬ 'kɔnwɨ̞]) is a fortification in Conwy, located in North Wales.

== History ==


=== 13th century ===
Before the English built the town of Conwy, Aberconwy Abbey, the site was occupied by a Cistercian monastery favoured by the Welsh princes, as well as the location of one of the palaces (called llys) of the Welsh princes. From Conwy: ""the oldest structure is part of the town walls, at the southern end of the east side. Here one wall and the tower of a llys [palace/court house] belonging to Llywelyn the Great and his grandson Llywelyn ap Gruffydd have been incorporated into the wall. Built on a rocky outcrop, with an apsidal tower, it is a classic, native, Welsh build and stands out from the rest of the town walls, due to the presence of four window openings. It dates from the early 13th century and is the most complete remnant of any of his Llys.""
The location also controlled an important crossing point over the River Conwy between the coastal and inland areas of North Wales, that Deganwy Castle for many years had defended. The kings of England and the Welsh princes had vied for control of the region since the 1070s and the conflict had resumed during the 13th century, leading to Edward I intervening in North Wales for the second time during his reign in 1282.

Edward invaded with a huge army, pushing north from Carmarthen and westwards from Montgomery and Chester. Edward captured Aberconwy in March 1283 and decided that the location would form the centre of a new county: he would relocate the abbey eight miles up the Conwy valley to a new site at Maenan, establishing Maenan Abbey, and build a new English castle and walled town on the monastery's former site. The ruined castle of Deganwy was abandoned and never rebuilt. Edward's plan was a colonial enterprise and placing the new town and walls on top of such a high-status native Welsh site was in part a symbolic act to demonstrate English power.Work began on cutting the ditch around Conwy Castle within days of Edward's decision. The work was controlled by Sir John Bonvillars and overseen by master mason James of St. George, and the first phase of work between 1283 and 1284 focused on creating the exterior curtain walls and towers. In the second phase, from 1284 and 1286, the interior buildings were erected, while work began on the walls for the neighbouring town. By 1287, the castle was complete. The builders recruited huge numbers of labourers from across England for the task. At each summer building season, the labourers massed at Chester and then walked into Wales. Edward's accountants did not separate the costs of the town walls from that of the castle, but the total cost of the two projects came to around £15,000, a huge sum for the period.The castle's constable was, by a royal charter of 1284, also the mayor of the new town of Conwy (to this day, the Mayor is ex-officio Constable of the Castle), and oversaw a castle garrison of 30 soldiers, including 15 crossbowmen, supported by a carpenter, chaplain, blacksmith, engineer and a stonemason. The first constable of the castle was Sir William de Cicon who had previously been the first constable of Rhuddlan Castle. In 1294 Madog ap Llywelyn rebelled against English rule. Edward was besieged at Conwy by the Welsh between December and January 1295, supplied only by sea, before forces arrived to relieve him in February. Chronicler Walter of Guisborough suggested that given the austere conditions Edward refused to drink his own private supply of wine, and instead had it shared out amongst the garrison. For some years afterwards, the castle formed the main residence for visiting senior figures, and hosted Edward's son, the future Edward II in 1301 when he visited the region to receive homage from the Welsh leaders.


=== 14th–15th centuries ===

Conwy Castle was not well maintained during the early 14th century and by 1321 a survey reported it was poorly equipped, with limited stores and suffering from leaking roofs and rotten timbers. These problems persisted until Edward, the Black Prince, took over control of the castle in 1343. Sir John Weston, his chamberlain, conducted repairs, building new stone support arches for the great hall and other parts of the castle. After the death of the Black Prince, however, Conwy fell into neglect again.At the end of the 14th century, the castle was used as a refuge by Richard II from the forces of his rival, Henry Bolingbroke. On 12 August 1399, after returning from Ireland, Richard made his way to the castle where he met Bolingbroke's emissary, Henry Percy, for negotiations. Percy swore in the chapel he would not harm the king. On 19 August, Richard surrendered to Percy at Flint Castle, promising to abdicate if his life were spared. The king was then taken to London and died later in captivity at Pontefract Castle.Henry Bolingbroke took the English throne to rule as Henry IV in 1400, but rebellion broke out in North Wales shortly afterwards under the leadership of Owain Glyndŵr. In March 1401, Rhys ap Tudur and his brother Gwilym, cousins of Owain Glyndŵr, undertook a surprise attack on Conwy Castle. Pretending to be carpenters repairing the castle, the two gained entry, killed the two watchmen on duty and took control of the fortress. Welsh rebels then attacked and captured the rest of the walled town. The brothers held out for around three months, before negotiating a surrender; as part of this agreement the pair were given a royal pardon by Henry.During the War of the Roses between 1455 and 1485, fought by the rival factions of the Lancastrians and the Yorkists, Conwy was reinforced but played little part in the fighting. Henry VIII conducted restoration work in the 1520s and 1530s, during which time the castle was being used as a prison, a depot and as a potential residence for visitors.


=== 17th–21st centuries ===

Conwy Castle fell into disrepair again by the early 17th century. Charles I sold it to Edward Conway in 1627 for £100, and Edward's son, also called Edward, inherited the ruin in 1631. In 1642 the English Civil War broke out between the Charles' royalist supporters and Parliament. John Williams, the Archbishop of York, took charge of the castle on behalf of the king, and set about repairing and garrisoning it at his own expense. In 1645, Sir John Owen was appointed governor of the castle instead, however, leading to a bitter dispute between the two men. The Archbishop defected to Parliament, the town of Conwy fell in August 1646 and in November General Thomas Mytton finally took the castle itself after a substantial siege. The Trevor family petitioned Mytton for the return of property in the castle that they had lent to the Archbishop.In the aftermath of the siege, Colonel John Carter was appointed governor of the castle and fresh repairs were carried out. In 1655 the Council of State appointed by Parliament ordered the castle to be slighted, or put beyond military use: the Bakehouse tower was probably deliberately partially pulled down at this time as part of the slighting. With the restoration of Charles II in 1660, Conway was returned to Edward Conway, the Earl of Conway, but five years later Edward decided to strip the remaining iron and lead from the castle and sell it off. The work was completed under the supervision of Edward Conway's overseer William Milward, despite opposition from the leading citizens of Conwy, and turned the castle into a total ruin.By the end of the 18th century, the ruins were considered picturesque and sublime, attracting visitors and artists, and paintings of the castle were made by Thomas Girtin, Moses Griffith, Julius Caesar Ibbetson, Paul Sandby and J. M. W. Turner. Several bridges were built across the River Conwy linking the town and Llandudno during the 19th century, including a road bridge in 1826 and a rail bridge in 1848. These improved communication links with the castle and further increased tourist numbers. In 1865 Conwy Castle passed from the Holland family, who had leased it from the descendants of the Conways to the civic leadership of Conwy town. Restoration work on the ruins then began, including the reconstruction of the damaged Bakehouse tower. In 1953 the castle was leased to the Ministry of Works and Arnold Taylor undertook a wide range of repairs and extensive research into the castle's history. An additional road bridge was built to the castle in 1958. Already protected as a scheduled monument, in 1986 it was also declared part of the World Heritage Site of the ""Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd"".In the 21st century the castle is managed by Cadw as a tourist attraction and 186,897 tourists visited the castle in 2010; a new visitor centre was opened in 2012. The castle requires ongoing maintenance and repairs cost £30,000 over the 2002–03 financial year.Cod with Himeji Castle, Hyogo prefecture, Japan at a formal ceremony in Himeji on 29 October 2019.


== Architecture ==

The castle hugs a rocky coastal ridge of grey sandstone and limestone, and much of the stone from the castle is largely taken from the ridge itself, probably when the site was first cleared. The local stone was not of sufficient quality to be used for carving details such as windows, however, and accordingly sandstone was brought in from the Creuddyn peninsula, Chester and the Wirral. This sandstone was more colourful than the local grey stone, and was probably deliberately chosen for its appearance.The castle has a rectangular plan and is divided into an Inner and Outer Ward, separated by a cross-wall, with four large, 70-foot (21 m) tall towers on each side; originally the castle would have been white-washed using a lime render. The outside of the towers still have the putlog holes from their original construction, where timbers were inserted to create a spiralling ramp for the builders. Although now somewhat decayed, the battlements originally sported triple finial designs and featured a sequence of square holes running along the outside of the walls. It is uncertain what these holes were used for – they may have been drainage holes, supports for defensive hoarding or for displaying ornamental shields.The main entrance to the castle is through the western barbican, an exterior defence in front of the main gate. When first built, the barbican was reached over a drawbridge and a masonry ramp that came up sharply from the town below; the modern path cuts east along the outside of the walls. The barbican features the earliest surviving stone machicolations in Britain, and the gate would originally have been protected by a portcullis.

The gate leads through to the Outer Ward which, when first built, would have been full of various administrative and service buildings. The north-west tower was reached through the porter's lodge and contained limited accommodation and space for stores. The south-west tower may have been used either by the castle's constable, or by the castle's garrison, and also contained a bakehouse. On the south side of the ward is a range of buildings that included the great hall and chapel, sitting on top of the cellars, which are now exposed. The stubs and one surviving stone arches from the 1340s can still be seen. Behind the great hall was the tower used by the constable for detaining prisoners; this included a special room for holding prisoners, called the ""dettors chambre"" (""debtors' chamber"") in the 16th century, and an underground dungeon. On the north side of the ward was a range of service buildings, including a kitchen, brewhouse and bakehouse, backed onto by the kitchen tower, containing accommodation and storerooms.The Inner Ward was originally separated from the Outer Ward by an internal wall, a drawbridge and a gate, protected by a ditch cut into the rock. The ditch was filled in during the 16th century and the drawbridge removed. The spring-fed castle well built alongside the gate survives, and today is 91-foot (28 m) deep. Inside, the ward contained the chambers for the royal household, their immediate staff and service facilities; today, historian Jeremy Ashbee considers them to be the ""best-preserved suite of medieval private royal chambers in England and Wales"". They were designed to form a royal palace in miniature, that could, if necessary, be sealed off from the rest of the castle and supplied from the eastern gate by sea almost indefinitely, although in practice they were rarely used by the royal family.

The royal rooms were positioned on the first floor of a range of buildings that ran around the outside of the ward, facing onto a courtyard. The four towers that protected the Inner Ward contained service facilities, with the Chapel Tower containing the private royal chapel. Each tower has an additional watchtower turret, probably intended both for security and to allow the prominent display of the royal flag. The arrangement was originally similar to that of the 13th century Gloriette at Corfe Castle, and provided a combination of privacy for the king while providing extensive personal security. The two sets of apartments were later unified into a single set of rooms, including a great chamber, outer chamber and inner chamber.On the east side of the Inner Ward is another barbican, enclosing the castle garden. This was overlooked by the royal apartments, and changed in style over the years: in the early 14th century there was a lawn, in the late 14th century vines, in the 16th century crab-apple trees and a lawn and in the 17th century formal ornamental flowers. A postern gate originally led down to the river where a small dock was built, allowing key visitors to enter the castle in private and for the fortress to be resupplied by boat, although this gate is now concealed by the later bridges built on the site.

The architecture of Conwy has close to links to that found in the County of Savoy in the same period. These include window styles, the type of crenellation used on the towers and positioning of putlog holes, and are usually ascribed to the influence of the Savoy architect Master James. Notably the three pinnacled merlons are a feature seen at the Savoyard Castello San Giorio di Susa which had been visited by Edward on his way back from crusade in 1273.


== Constable of the Castle ==
The official roles of the Constable were - Governor of the castle, governor of the fortified borough, keeper of the castle gaol (prison), Mayor (Latin: ex officio) and extraordinary duties.During 1283 the castle was recorded to have a garrison of : 30 men (Latin: Homines defensabiles), 15 cross-bowmen (Latin: Baslistarii), 1 superintendent at arms (Latin: Attilliator), 1 Chaplain (Latin: Capellanus), 1 Stone mason (Latin: Cementarius), 1 Carpenter (Latin: Carpentarius), 1 Artisan (Latin: Faber), 10 residents (Latin: Residuum), William De Sikun was the constable with a yearly fee of £190 (equivalent to £200,000 in 2020).

== Biography ==
John Bowdler was the younger son of John Bowdler the elder. He was born in London on 2 February 1783. He had a brother, Thomas Bowdler the Younger. He was educated at Sevenoaks School, Hyde Abbey School, and Winchester College.In 1798 he was placed in a London solicitor's office. In 1807 he was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn, made some progress in his profession, and attracted the notice of Lord-Chancellor Eldon.In 1810 he began to show signs of tuberculosis, and for the sake of his health spent the two following years in southern Europe.In May 1812, he returned to Britain, and lived with an aunt near Portsmouth; but his health was not restored, Bowdler died on 1 February 1815.


== Literary works ==
Bowdler engaged in literary pursuits during his illness, and in 1816 his father published his Select Pieces in Prose and Verse (2 vols.) This book contained a memoir and the journal kept by Bowdler during his tour of 1810 - 1812, as well as an exposition of Dugald Stewart's philosophical theories and religious essays and poems. It was reprinted in 1817, 1818, 1819, and 1820. Selections from its religious portions appeared in 1821 and 1823, and in 1857 the author's brother Charles reissued a part of it under the title of The Religion of the Heart, as exemplified in the Life and Writings of John Bowdler. This edition included a new biographic preface and previously unpublished correspondence.

This Wind River Range alpine glacier is associated with the largest grouping of glaciers in the U.S. Rocky Mountains and lies on the north slope of Fremont Peak, the third tallest mountain in Wyoming. Upper Fremont Glacier is at an average altitude of 13,450 ft (4,100 m) and is one of the highest altitude glaciers in the American Rockies.Ice core samples were taken from Upper Fremont Glacier in 1990-1991. These ice cores were analyzed for climatic changes as well as alterations of atmospheric chemicals. In 1998 an unbroken ice core sample of 538 ft (164 m) was taken from the glacier and subsequent analysis of the ice showed an abrupt change in the oxygen isotope ratio oxygen-18 to oxygen-16 in conjunction with what is widely regarded as the end of the Little Ice Age, a period of cooler global temperatures between the years 1550 and 1850. A linkage was established with a similar ice core study which had been undertaken on the Quelccaya Ice Cap in Peru, which also demonstrated the same changes in the oxygen isotope ratio during the same period. The climatic implications from the ice cores taken from both sites support evidence of a sudden global climate change during the mid 19th century.

Ice cores from the glacier also showed increased levels of Tritium (3H) and chlorine-36 around the year 1963, which coincides with the peak period of above ground nuclear testing.The same ice cores were also tested for Mercury deposition from natural and human-induced activities. This is the first known instance in which ice cores have been used to determine Mercury deposition from a mid-latitude glacier in North America, as all previous studies have been derived from other sources. The majority of Mercury deposition is by way of the atmosphere and sources of the element may be from volcanic activity or from industrialization, but volcanoes contribute a small proportion of the Mercury. The ice core samples from the Upper Fremont Glacier indicated that levels of Mercury increased dramatically during the industrial revolution and have decreased significantly since the mid-1980s. It is believed that the decrease in Mercury deposition since the 1980s coincides with the passage of the Clean Air Act.

== History ==


=== Origins ===

Trade cards are the ancestors of trading cards. Some of the earliest prizes found in retail products were cigarette cards—trade cards advertising the product (not to be confused with trading cards) that were inserted into paper packs of cigarettes as stiffeners to protect the contents. Allen and Ginter in the U.S. in 1886, and British company W.D. & H.O. Wills in 1888, were the first tobacco companies to print advertisements. A couple years later, lithograph pictures on the cards with an encyclopedic variety of topics from nature to war to sports — subjects that appealed to men who smoked - began to surface as well. By 1900, there were thousands of tobacco card sets manufactured by 300 different companies. Children would stand outside of stores to ask customers who bought cigarettes for the promotional cards. Following the success of cigarette cards, trade cards were produced by manufacturers of other products and included in the product or handed to the customer by the store clerk at the time of purchase. World War II put an end to cigarette card production due to limited paper resources, and after the war cigarette cards never really made a comeback. After that collectors of prizes from retail products took to collecting tea cards in the UK and bubble gum cards in the US.


=== Early baseball cards ===

The first baseball cards were trade cards printed in the late 1860s by a sporting goods company, around the time baseball became a professional sport. Most of the baseball cards around the beginning of the 20th century came in candy and tobacco products. It was during this era that the most valuable baseball card ever printed was produced - the T206 tobacco card featuring Honus Wagner. The T206 Set, distributed by the American Tobacco Company in 1909, is considered by collectors to be the most popular set of all time. In 1933, Goudey Gum Company of Boston issued baseball cards with players biographies on the backs and was the first to put baseball cards in bubble gum. The 1933 Goudey set remains one of the most popular and affordable vintage sets to this day. Bowman Gum of Philadelphia issued its first baseball cards in 1948.


=== Modern trading cards ===
Topps Chewing Gum, Inc., now known as ""The Topps Company, Inc."", started inserting trading cards into bubble gum packs in 1950 with such topics as TV and film cowboy Hopalong Cassidy; ""Bring 'Em Back Alive"" cards featuring Frank Buck on big game hunts in Africa; and All-American Football Cards. Topps produced its first baseball trading card set in 1951, with the resulting design resembling that of playing cards. Topps owner and founder Sy Berger created the first true modern baseball card set, complete with playing record and statistics, the following year in the form of 1952 Topps Baseball. This is one of the most popular sets of all time; its most valued piece was 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle #311, which is sometimes erroneously referred to as Mantle's rookie card, though he had in fact appeared in the 1951 Bowman Baseball set.Topps purchased their chief competitor, Bowman Gum, in 1956. Topps was the leader in the trading card industry from 1956 to 1980, not only in sports cards but in entertainment cards as well. Many of the top selling non-sports cards were produced by Topps, including Wacky Packages (1967, 1973–1977), Star Wars (beginning in 1977) and Garbage Pail Kids (beginning in 1985). In 1991 Topps ceased packaging gum with their baseball cards, making many collectors happy that their cards could no longer be damaged by gum stains The following year, in 1992, Topps ceased using heavily waxed paper to wrap their packs of cards and began using cellophane plastic exclusively, thus eliminating the possibility of wax stains on the top and bottom cards in the packs.


=== Digital trading cards ===
In an attempt to stay current with technology and digital trends, existing and new trading card companies started to create digital trading cards that lived exclusively online or as a digital counterpart of a physical card.
In 1995 Michael A. Pace produced ""computer based"" trading cards, utilizing a CD ROM computer system and floppy discs.In 2000, Topps launched a brand of sports cards, called etopps. These cards were sold exclusively online through individual IPO's (initial player offering) in which the card is offered for usually a week at the IPO price. That same year, Tokenzone launched a digital collectibles platform that was used by media companies to distribute content in the form of digital trading cards. The quantity sold depended on how many people offered to buy but was limited to a certain maximum. After a sale, the cards were held in a climate-controlled warehouse unless the buyer requests delivery, and the cards could be traded online without changing hands except in the virtual sense. In January 2012, Topps announced that they would be discontinuing their eTopps product line.Digital collectible card games were estimated to be a $1.3B market in 2013. A number of tech start-ups have attempted to establish themselves in this space, notably Stampii (Spain, 2009), Fantom (Ireland, 2011), Deckdaq (Israel, 2011), and 2Stic (Austria, 2013).
Panini launched their Adrenalyn XL platform with an NBA and NFL trading card collection. Connect2Media together with Winning Moves, created an iPhone Application to host a series of trading card collections, including Dinosaurs, James Bond - 007, Celebs, Gum Ball 3000, European Football Stars and NBA. In 2011, mytcg Technologies launched a platform that enabled content holders to host their content on.
On July 1, 2011, Wildcat Intellectual Property Holdings filed a lawsuit against 12 defendants, including Topps, Panini, Sony, Electronic Arts, Konami, Pokémon, Zynga and Nintendo, for allegedly infringing Wildcat's ""Electronic Trading Card"" patent.In 2012, Topps also launched their first phone application.  Topps Bunt was an app that allowed users to connect with other fans in a fantasy league type game environment wherein they can collect their favorite players, earn points based on how well they play and trade and compete with other fans. Three years later, the same company launched a digital experiment in Europe (geotargeted to exclude the USA) with its Marvel Hero Attax, using digital as an overlay to its physical product.


== Value ==
Today, the development of the Internet has given rise to various online communities, through which members can trade collectible cards with each other. Cards are often bought and sold via eBay and other online retail sources. Many websites solicit their own ""sell to us"" page in hopes to draw in more purchase opportunities.The value of a trading card depends on a combination of the card's condition, the subject's popularity and the scarcity of the card. In some cases, especially with older cards that preceded the advent of card collecting as a widespread hobby, they have become collectors' items of considerable value. In recent years, many sports cards have not necessarily appreciated as much in value due to overproduction, although some manufacturers have used limited editions and smaller print runs to boost value. Trading cards, however, do not have an absolute monetary value. Cards are only worth as much as a collector is willing to pay.


=== Condition ===
Card condition is one aspect of trading cards that determine the value of a card. There are four areas of interest in determining a card's condition. Centering, corners, edges and surface are taken into consideration, for imperfections, such as color spots and blurred images, and wear, such as creases, scratches and tears, when determining a trading card's value. Cards are considered poor to pristine based on their condition, or in some cases rated 1 through 10. A card in pristine condition, for example, will generally be valued higher than a card in poor condition.


=== Popularity ===
Popularity of trading cards is determined by the subject represented on the card, their real life accomplishments, and short term news coverage as well as the specifics of the card.


=== Scarcity ===
While vintage cards are truly a scarce commodity, modern-day manufacturers have to artificially add value to their products in order to make them scarce. This is accomplished by including serial-numbered parallel sets, cards with game-worn memorabilia, autographs, and more. Time can also make cards more scarce due to the fact that cards may be lost or destroyed.


== Catalogs ==
Trading card catalogs are available both online and offline for enthusiast. They are mainly used as an educational tool and to identify cards. Online catalogs also contain additional resources for collection management and communication between collectors.


== Terminology ==


== Sports cards ==
Sports card is a generic term for a trading card with a sports-related subject, as opposed to non-sports trading cards that deal with other topics. Sports cards were among the earliest forms of collectibles. They typically consist of a picture of a player on one side, with statistics or other information on the reverse. Cards have been produced featuring most major sports, especially those played in North America, including, but not limited to, American football, association football (soccer), baseball, basketball, boxing, golf, ice hockey, racing and tennis.
The first set with a sporting theme appeared in 1896, a cricket series by W.D. & H.O. Wills of 50 cricketers. The tobacco companies soon realised that sports cards were a great way to obtain brand loyalty. In 1896 the first association football set, ""Footballers & Club Colours"", was published by Marcus & Company, a small firm in Manchester. Other football sets issued at that time were ""Footballers & Club Colours"" (Kinner, 1898); ""Footballers"" (J. F. Bell, 1902); ""Footballers"" (F. J. Smith, 1902) and ""Footballers"" (Percy E. Cadle, 1904).The first stage in the development of sports cards, during the second half of the 19th century, is essentially the story of baseball cards, since baseball was the first sport to become widely professionalized. Hockey cards also began to appear early in the 20th century. Cards from this period are commonly known as cigarette cards or tobacco cards, because many were produced by tobacco companies and inserted into cigarette packages, to stiffen cigarette packaging and advertise cigarette brands. The most expensive card in the hobby is a cigarette card of Honus Wagner in a set called 1909 T-206. The story told is that Wagner was against his cards being inserted into something that children would collect. So the production of his cards stopped abruptly. It is assumed that less than 100 of his cards exist in this set. The 1909 T-206 Honus Wagner card has sold for as much as $2.8 million.Sets of cards are issued with each season for major professional sports. Since companies typically must pay players for the right to use their images, the vast majority of sports cards feature professional athletes. Amateurs appear only rarely, usually on cards produced or authorized by the institution they compete for, such as a college.
Many older sports cards (pre-1980) command a high price today; this is because they are hard to find, especially in good quality condition. This happened because many children used to place their cards in bicycle spokes, where the cards were easily damaged. Rookie cards of Hall of Fame sports stars can command thousands of dollars if they have been relatively well-preserved.
In the 1980s, sports cards started to get produced in higher numbers, and collectors started to keep their cards in better condition as they became increasingly aware of their potential investment value. This trend continued well into the 1990s. This practice caused many of the cards manufactured during this era to stay low in value, due to their high numbers.
The proliferation of cards saturated the market, and by the late 1990s, card companies began to produce scarcer versions of cards to keep many collectors interested. The latest trends in the hobby have been ""game used memorabilia"" cards, which usually feature a piece of a player's jersey worn in a real professional game; other memorabilia cards include pieces of bats, balls, hats, helmets, and floors. Authenticated autographs are also popular, as are ""serially numbered"" cards, which are produced in much smaller amounts than regular ""base set cards"".
Autographs obtained by card manufacturers have become the most collected baseball cards in the hobby's history. This started in 1990 in baseball when Upper Deck randomly inserted autographs of Reggie Jackson into boxes. They are commonly referred to as ""Certified Autographed Inserts"" or ""CAI's"". Both the athlete's and card company's reputations are on the line if they do not personally sign these cards. This has created the most authentic autographs in existence. These cards all have some form of printed statements that the autographs are authentic, this way, no matter who owns the autograph there is no question of its authenticity. CAI's have branched out into autographs of famous actors, musicians, Presidents, and even Albert Einstein. Mostly these autographs are cut from flat items such as postcards, index cards, and plain paper. Then they are pasted onto cards. In 2001, a company called Playoff started obtaining autographs on stickers that are stuck on the cards instead of them actually signing the cards. There is strong opposition against these types of autographs because the players never even saw the cards that the stickers were affixed to.The competition among card companies to produce quality sports cards has been fierce. In 2005, the long-standing sports card producer Fleer went bankrupt and was bought out by Upper Deck. Not long after that, Donruss lost its MLB license. Currently, Topps is the official baseball card of the MLB.


=== Association football ===

The first association football (or ""soccer"") cards were produced in 1898 by the Marcus & Company Tobacco in Manchester, England. The set consisted of over 100 cards and was issued under the title of ""Club Colours"". They featured illustrated images of players on the front of the card, and a tobacco advertisement on the back of the card. Many other cigarette companies quickly created their own series, beginning with Kinner in 1898. A later series of cards was produced in 1934 by Ardath, which was a 50-card set called Famous Footballers featuring images of players on the front of the card, and a tobacco advertisement and short biography of the player on the back of the card.
Modern association football trading cards were sold with bubble gum in the United Kingdom from 1958 to 1975 by A&BC, and later by Topps, UK from 1975 to 1981. Similar smaller sized cards were issued in Spain and Italy beginning in the late 1940s. Cards have been produced from 1981 to present, save 1985 and 1986. Under its Merlin brand, since 1994 Topps has held the licence to produce stickers for the Premier League sticker album. Launched by Topps in the 2007–08 season, Match Attax, the official Premier League trading card game, is the best selling boys collectable in the UK – with around 1.5m collectors in the UK – and with global sales it is also the biggest selling sports trading card game in the world.

Other variations of football products exist, such as marbles, cut-outs, coins, stamps and stickers, some made of light cardboard and attached with glue or stickers, into sticker albums specifically issued for the products. Forming a partnership with FIFA in 1970, Panini first produced a World Cup sticker album for the 1970 World Cup. Initiating a craze for collecting and trading stickers, since then, it has become part of the World Cup experience, especially for the younger generation. The Guardian states, “the tradition of swapping duplicate [World Cup] stickers was a playground fixture during the 1970s and 1980s.” Panini begins assembling World Cup squads for their sticker album a few months before they are officially announced by each nation, which means surprise call ups often don’t feature in their album. A notable example of this was 17-year-old Brazilian striker Ronaldo who was called up for the Brazil squad for the 1994 FIFA World Cup.Panini’s football trading card game Adrenalyn XL was introduced in 2009. In 2010 Panini released a UEFA Champions League edition of Adrenalyn XL, containing 350 cards from 22 of the competing clubs, including defending champions FC Barcelona. The fourth edition of Panini FIFA 365 Adrenalyn XL was released for 2019, featuring top clubs, teams and players.


=== Australian rules football ===

Australian rules football cards are almost exclusively found in Australia as no top-level leagues are present outside the country. The first Australian rules football cards were produced in conjunction with Goodwin & Co's Old Judge Cigarettes in the late 1880s. In the set were Australian celebrities which included Australian rules footballers from Victoria and South Australia. Other companies that issued earlier football cards were W.D. & H.O. Wills in 1905, and Sniders & Abrahams (featuring scenes of matches in 1908 and then releasing other sets with portraits of football players in the 1910s, all in full color). In the 1930s, the Australian division of British Godfrey Phillips Co. released a set of football cards. By the same time, Hoadleys, a local confectionery company, released a set of illustrated cards. Another confectionery company, Clarke-Ellis, also released its own set of cards. Other companies that launched cards sets in the 1930s were Pals Periodical, Plaistowe & Co., Carreras (two illustrated sets in 1933, the first of them with footballers caricatures by Bob Miram), Giant Licorice Cigarettes, MacRobertson's and W.D. & H.O. Wills, among others. The most popular set of Australian rules football cards are often the considered to be the 1963 Scanlens card set. Select Australia is currently the longest continuously operating and largest producer of Australian rules football cards. Prices for Australian rules football cards can be relatively high compared to other sporting codes in Australia. This is illustrated for both vintage and modern cards, such as an 1894 American Tobacco Company card featuring Essendon player Will Crebbin which sold for $10,110 in 2018 and a 2004 Select AFL Conquest Triple Brownlow Medallist signature card featuring Nathan Buckley, Adam Goodes and Mark Ricciuto which was valued at $3,000 in 2018.


=== Baseball ===

Baseball cards will usually feature one or more baseball players or other baseball-related sports figures. The front of the card typically displays an image of the player with identifying information, including, but not limited to, the player's name and team affiliation. The reverse of most modern cards displays statistics and/or biographical information. Cards are most often found in the United States but are also common in countries such as Canada, Cuba, and Japan, where baseball is a popular sport and there are professional leagues.
The earliest baseball cards were in the form of trade cards produced in 1868. They evolved into tobacco cards by 1886. In the early 20th century other industries began printing their own version of baseball cards to promote their products, such as bakery/bread cards, caramel cards, dairy cards, game cards and publication cards. Between the 1930s and 1960s the cards developed into trading cards, becoming their own product. In 1957, Topps changed the dimensions of its cards slightly, to 2-1/2 inches by 3-1/2 inches, setting a standard that remains the basic format for most sports cards produced in the United States.


=== Basketball ===
 
Basketball cards feature one or more players of the NBA, NCAA, Olympic basketball, WNBA, WBL, or some other basketball-related theme. The first basketball cards were produced in 1910, in a series cataloged as ""College Athlete Felts B-33"". The complete series included ten different sports, with only 30 cards being associated with basketball. The cards were issued as a cigarette redemption premium by Egyptiene Cigarettes. The number of cigarette packages needed to redeem for the tobacco cards is not known.
The next series of basketball cards were issued in 1911, in two separate series; ""T6 College Series"", measuring approximately 6"" by 8"", and ""T51 College Series"", measuring approximately 2"" by 3"". These series included a variety of sports, with only 4 cards being associated with basketball, one card from the T6 series and three cards from the T51 series. Both series were produced in two variations, one variation reading ""College Series"", the other, ""2nd Series"". The cards were acquired in trade for fifteen Murad cigarette coupons. The offer expired June 30, 1911.Basketball cards were not seen again until 1932, when C.A. Briggs Chocolate issued a 31-card set containing multiple sports. In exchange for a completed set of cards, Briggs offered baseball equipment. The number of basketball cards in the set is not known.


=== Boxing ===
One of the first boxing cards on record in ""America's Greatest Boxing Cards"" and encyclopedia and check-list of boxing cards, was of John C. Heenan issued by photographs Charles D. Fredericks in the 1860s. The first set of boxer cards was issued by Goodwin & Company in 1886. Other companies, including Duke and Sons and the Lorillard Tobacco Company, also issued boxing cards in this period. American company Allen & Ginter issued several boxing cards in the ""World Champions"" series, among other sportsmen.After the World War II, other companies took over the manufacturing of boxing cards, such as Leaf (1948), Topps (1951) and Donruss.More recently, Upper Deck released several boxing series.


=== Cricket ===
Cricket cards usually feature one or more players or a cricket-related theme. One of the first cricket collections was released by tobacco company W.D. & H.O. Wills in 1896. Other companies that released cricket collections were Australian Sniders & Abrahams in 1905, and Capstan (a Wills brand) in 1909–10. Alexander Boguslavsky Ltd. also released an illustrated sports collection (that included cricket) in 1925.In modern times, cricket cards have been produced by Futera (1993–98) and Topps.

Panini released collections of some of the most famous bicycle races in Europe, such as the Tour de France and the Giro d'Italia.


=== Gridiron football ===

A gridiron football card is a type of collectible trading card typically printed on paper stock or card stock that features one or more American football, Canadian Football League all or World League of American Football players or other related sports figures.

During the 1920s, some hockey cards were printed by food and candy companies, such as Paulin's Candy, Maple Crispette, Crescent, Holland Creameries and La Patrie.
Through 1941, O-Pee-Chee printed hockey cards, stopping production for World War II. Presumably, the 1941 involvement of the US in the war affected the hockey card market, since Canada had been in the war since 1939.
Hockey cards next appeared during 1951–52, issued by Shirriff Desserts, York Peanut Butter and Post Cereal. Toronto's Parkhurst Products Company began printing cards in 1951, followed by Brooklyn's Topps Chewing Gum in 1954–1955.

Early in the 1920's the first dedicated Rugby League series was produced, featuring star players from the Northern Union, as the English based Rugby Football League was then known. These were followed shortly after by cards produced in Australia, New Zealand, and Wales. Rugby League trading cards are popular in Australia, with sets having been produced annually since 1968. These sets primarily featured players from the Sydney based New South Wales Rugby Football League, with some sets also being produced featuring players from the Brisbane based Queensland Rugby League.

Seven Champions of Christendom,"['Articles with Internet Archive links', 'Articles with Project Gutenberg links', 'Groups of Christian saints', 'Groups of Roman Catholic saints']","The Seven Champions of Christendom is an epithet referring to St. George, St. Andrew, St. Patrick, St. Denis, St. James Boanerges, St. Anthony the Lesser, and St. David. They are the patron saints of, respectively, England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Spain, Portugal, and Wales.
The champions were depicted in Christian art and folklore in Great Britain as heroic warriors, most notably in a 1596 book by Richard Johnson titled Famous Historie of the Seaven Champions of Christendom.

It was previously classified as a variety of S. purpurea subsp. venosa (var. burkii). The proposition for the plant to be named a new species arose in 1999. This proposition was based on three main factors: S. rosea has larger flowers on shorter stalks; it produces light pink petals, a feature no other species in the genus exhibits; and it has a somewhat different pitcher structure than S. purpurea.  A form which lacks anthocyanins has been described as Sarracenia rosea f. luteola.
The species is native to the Gulf Coast of the Southeastern United States, and has been found from Mississippi to Georgia. However, the areas in which the plant occurs are being developed, so the species's habitat is threatened. However along with Sarracenia psittacina, this species readily colonizes drainage ditches along highways throughout the gulf states providing a somewhat more sustainable albeit less natural habitat.

== Botanical history ==
Sarracenia rosea was first identified by the American botanist Edgar T. Wherry as a ""mutant"" form of S. purpurea in 1933 based on specimens collected by Frank Morton Jones in 1910 near Theodore, Alabama and Wherry's own collections in 1932, likely also from southern Alabama. These plants differed from S. purpurea in the rose-pink petals and nearly white style (S. purpurea has deep maroon petals and the style is typically green). Wherry sent specimens to Louis Burk, a Philadelphia horticulturalist, who confirmed Wherry's field observations in greenhouse-grown plants. Wherry followed this revelation and suggested naming the variety in honor of Burk, but it remained unpublished.Based on the morphological differences from the southern subspecies, S. purpurea subsp. venosa, and the geographic isolation of the populations with pink petals along the Gulf Coast, the American botanist Donald E. Schnell formally described this taxon in a 1993 issue of Rhodora, the journal of the New England Botanical Club. Schnell decided to place this taxon at the rank of variety below subsp. venosa as S. purpurea var. burkii, honoring Louis Burk as Wherry had suggested 60 years earlier. In 1999, however, botanists Robert Naczi, then a professor of biology at Northern Kentucky University, and Frederick and Roberta Case elevated the variety to species rank, naming it Sarracenia rosea. They compiled morphological data from specimens of S. purpurea and S. rosea and found significant differences in scape height, petal size, pitcher ""lip"" thickness, and pitcher leaf morphology. All of this evidence, combined with the allopatric distribution that does not overlap with S. purpurea, lead the authors to determine the Gulf Coast populations with pink petals are worthy of recognition at species rank. They chose to assign a new epithet, rosea, to the species rather than utilize the varietal epithet burkii as allowed under article 11.2 of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature to avoid confusion and express the color of the flowers in the species epithet.

For several years he has been studying the relationship between cancer and cell differentiation: he has identified specific networks of stem cell growth factors, which as epigenetic regulators are able to control the expression of various genes capable of slowing down cellular aging and regenerating different types of tissue without the need for stem cell transplantation.He has also identified specific networks of differentiation factors capable of reprogramming pathological stem cells, such as cancer and cells of the germinative layer of the epidermis altered in psoriasis. He also emphasized that in order to reprogram altered stem cells or to regenerate a tissue it is necessary to regulate many genes at the same time and not a single gene.

== Synopsis ==
This film revolves around a killer who suffers from a mental disorder which causes him to kill those who he is attracted to. Karisma Kapoor plays a girl from Delhi named Neha Chopra, who gets a new job as an interior designer in Nainital, and moves to lonely neighbourhood to pursue her career. She later falls in love with a man named Raj Singh, who is played by Dino Morea. However, the cops inform her that he may be the killer of many young beautiful girls in the area, and she doubts the cops until something causes her to doubt him instead, so she decides to leave the city. The police officer Harshvardhan Bhatti (played by Sunil Shetty) asks her to see the condition of the sister of a victim who witnessed the murder, but is in coma. Seeing her terrible condition, Neha decides to stay and help with the case and acts as if she is in love with Raj. Raj who has lost the love from Neha has to now gain her trust back and save her from the dangers that await her.


== Plot ==
The film opens with the life of a child born with a strange disorder where he tends to destroy anything that fascinates him. He would be looked after by his grandmother.
Then the film moves to Nainital 17 years later, where Neha Chopra (Karisma Kapoor) from Delhi comes to Nainital to work as an interior designer for Jai Singh Dabral (Jackie Shroff), the city Mayor who is also a womaniser and attracted to Neha, at one of his secluded and deserted mansions. A serial killer is said to be on the prowl in the city, killing beautiful women ruthlessly and who is always eluding the police, getting away from the law without evidence if at all he gets arrested. Neha soon meets Raj Singh (Dino Morea), a loafer whom everyone in the city seems to avoid as he is the suspected serial killer, but she likes him, and soon both fall in love. The city police commissioner Harshvardhan Bhatti (Sunil Shetty) and subordinate Preeti Rastogi (Preeti Jhangiani) observe the movements of the couple all over the city, and soon they call Neha and warn her that Raj is a serial killer and she must help them nab him red handed as she is soon going to be his next victim. Neha refuses to believe, especially because Raj saves her life on one occasion. But later she finds items of murder in Raj's house, and thinks Raj is the killer. Brokenhearted, she then decides to leave Nainital for good, much against Dabral's wishes, but Harshvardhan and Preeti convince her to stay back and nab Raj red handed.
Raj goes to meet Neha but sees that she is very dull, knowing that something is wrong. Soon one of the killer's victim's sister comes out of coma and tells Preeti that she can identify the killer. Preeti informs Harshvardhan, but when they both arrive at the house, the comatose girl dies of shock unexpectedly. Later that night Preeti thinks over everything, and goes to question Harshvardhan. Dabral notices her racing in her car somewhere at night. The next day, Preeti is found murdered in Raj's house. Raj is chased by Harshvardhan and the cops till he jumps off a waterfall and seeks shelter in Neha's house.
Dabral threatens to Demote Harshvardhan if he does not nab the killer in 24 hours, to which the latter replies assertively. Harshvardhan gives a mobile phone to Neha, telling her that if Raj calls on her, she must dial his number and inform him immediately. Raj does go to Neha to explain his situation but she pushes him off and dials Harshvardhan.  Surprisingly, Harshvardhan does not answer the phone. She then leaves a voice message saying that Raj has come to kill her. Raj hits Neha and she falls unconscious.
Then the movie reaches its climax where Harshvardhan appears on the scene. He takes Raj and the unconscious Neha to a temple where Raj and Neha had been before and chains him there. Here, Harshvardhan changes completely. He tells Raj that he is the serial killer, the child who was neglected always because of his disorder. So he sought to make his 'own' world. It was he who committed all the murders and hid their bodies. He also says that he had to murder Preeti because she had come to know of things told everything she knew to his grandmother, had also stumbled upon his secret hideout, and would've spilled the beans. It is also known that Harshvardhan never had any feelings for Preeti at all, though she was madly in love with him and was hoping he would reciprocate. He goes on to say that Neha is his alone, and he will take her. He was the one who also framed Raj by placing the items of murder in his house. He says ""Kaam mera, naam tera"", meaning that he has recorded Neha's voice message stating that Raj is the killer, and Raj will be convicted. Harshvardhan then takes Neha to his underground enclosure to kill her, where they find bodies of women kept in glass boxes, as though it were a park. He says that nothing can separate them both now.
In the meantime, Dabral comes and frees Raj, and both of them attack him at his house. A huge fight ensues between the three of them and suddenly, Harshvardhan's grandmother appears on the scene out of nowhere and shoots Harshvardhan.
The film ends with Raj and Neha planning to get married, and Dabral giving the deserted house for them to live in.

HMCS Ypres,"['1917 ships', 'Auxiliary ships of the Royal Canadian Navy', 'Battle-class trawlers', 'Maritime incidents in May 1940', 'Ships sunk in collisions', 'Shipwrecks of Canada', 'World War I naval ships of Canada']","HMCS Ypres was one of twelve Battle-class naval trawlers constructed for and used by the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) during the First World War. Named after the Second and Third battles of Ypres, the ship entered service in 1918, patrolling the east coast of Canada for submarine activity. Following the war, the ship remained in service with as a patrol and training ship. In 1938, the vessel recommissioned as a gate vessel, re-designated Gate Vessel 1, in service at Halifax, Nova Scotia. On 12 May 1940, the gate vessel was rammed and sunk in a collision with the British battleship HMS Revenge.","HMCS Ypres was one of twelve Battle-class naval trawlers constructed for and used by the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) during the First World War.

On 12 May 1940, the gate vessel was rammed and sunk in a collision with the British battleship HMS Revenge.


== Design and description ==
The RCN's Battle-class trawlers formed part of the Canadian naval response to Admiralty warnings to Canada about the growing German U-boat threat to merchant shipping in the western Atlantic. Intended to augment anti-submarine patrols off Canada's east coast, these ships were modelled on contemporary British North Sea trawlers, since the standard types of Canadian fishing vessels were considered unsuitable for patrol work.Twelve vessels were ordered on 2 February 1917 from two shipyards, Polson Iron Works of Toronto and Canadian Vickers of Montreal. Those vessels built at Polson Iron Works displaced 320 long tons (330 t) and were 130 feet (40 m) long overall with a beam of 23 feet 5 inches (7.14 m) and a draught of 13 feet 5 inches (4.09 m). They were propelled by a steam-powered triple expansion engine driving one shaft creating 480 indicated horsepower (360 kW) giving the vessels a maximum speed of 10 knots (19 km/h; 12 mph).All twelve trawlers were equipped with a QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval gun mounted forward. This was considered to be the smallest gun that stood a chance of putting a surfaced U-boat out of action, and they also carried a small number of depth charges. The trawlers were named after battles of the Western Front during the First World War that Canadians had been involved in. They cost between $155,000 and $160,000 per vessel.


== Service history ==
Ypres was constructed by Polson Iron Works at Toronto and was launched on 16 June 1917. Intended for use during the 1917 shipping season, the construction of the vessels was delayed by the entry of the United States into the war. With higher wages found south of the border, a shortage of skilled labour developed in the shipyards, coupled with a shortage of construction material. The trawler was commissioned on 13 November 1917. Ypres sailed to Halifax following her commissioning for defence of the Atlantic coast of Canada. For the defence of shipping in Canadian waters in 1918, the entire Battle class was assigned to work out of Sydney, Nova Scotia.The ship remained in Canadian service following the end of the war until being paid off in 1920. After being recommissioned on 1 May 1923 as a training ship on the east coast, having been re-designated a minesweeper in 1922. With sister ship Festubert, Ypres trained with the destroyers on the east coast until  November 1932 she was again paid off and was placed in reserve. Refitted as a gate vessel in 1938 and recommissioned, Ypres, designated Gate Vessel 1, formed part of the Halifax boom defences until 12 May 1940, when she was rammed and sunk by the British battleship Revenge.


=== Sinking ===

The battleship was departing to escort two troop transports sailing for the United Kingdom when a request was made for the boom to be opened for her at 1830. Revenge began making her way towards the gate, which opened at 1826. However, before arriving at the gate, the battleship stopped inside the harbour, closer to the gate. The two troop transports had not joined up with the battleship on time and the officer in charge of gate operations did not inform the gate vessels of the change in departure time. When the ships finally did sail, the gate vessels had little time to get the gate open fully. Gate Vessel 1 reported the gate being open at 2055 and at 2056, Revenge rammed the gate vessel, rolling the trawler almost onto her side and flooding Gate Vessel 1 through her upper deck openings. The trawler, attached to the boom, bounced off the side of the battleship, which dragged the trawler and boom for roughly 500 yards (460 m) before the battleship came to a halt. Gate Vessel 1 was abandoned as the ship settled onto the boom and sank at roughly 2125. There was no loss of life in the collision, with Revenge collecting thirteen members of the crew and Gate Vessel 2 (sister Festubert) collecting five more sailors, one of them a member of Revenge's crew who had jumped overboard to save a Canadian. Revenge and her convoy sailed once ascertaining that there had been no deaths. Another Battle-class trawler, Arleux, assumed Ypres' position as Gate Vessel 1. After this incident, the crews of other gate vessels would pretend to make elaborate preparations for a collision every time Revenge visited Halifax.

Yetnebersh Nigussie,"['1982 births', 'Articles with hCards', 'Blind people', 'Ethiopian disability rights activists', 'Living people', 'People from Amhara Region']","Yetnebersh Nigussie is a lawyer and disability rights activist from Ethiopia. In 2017, she was awarded the Right Livelihood Award for ""her inspiring work promoting the rights and inclusion of people with disabilities, allowing them to realise their full potential and changing mindsets in our societies.""","Yetnebersh Nigussie is a lawyer and disability rights activist from Ethiopia. In 2017, she was awarded the Right Livelihood Award for ""her inspiring work promoting the rights and inclusion of people with disabilities, allowing them to realise their full potential and changing mindsets in our societies.""


== Early life and education ==
Yetnebersh Nigussie lost her eyesight at the age of 5. She describes this instance as an opportunity as it helped her to escape from the early marriage which was widely exercised in Amhara region, at the place where Yetnebersh was born. She attended her primary classes in Shashemane Catholic School for the Blind, then joined Menelik II Senior Secondary School (an inclusive school) and studied there until 12th grade. In addition to her academic involvement in the school, she has chaired more than 6 students’ clubs including the students’ counsel. Joining Addis Ababa University, she attained her undergraduate degree in law and her master's in social work. Continuously involved in extracurricular activities, she chaired the AAU Anti-AIDS movement 2004–05 and founded the Addis Ababa University (AAU) Female Students Association in 2006 as well as served as the first president of the association.


== Activism ==
During her service for the Anti-AIDS movement, she has received a number of national and international awards including the AMANITARE award (African Partnership for Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights of Women and Girls)  which she received in 2003 in South Africa for her strong advocacy work for girls’ education. Besides her academic life, Ms. Yetnebersh served in more than 20 organizations voluntarily out of which the Ethiopian National Association of the Blind Women’s Wing happened to be the one she chaired for 4 years (2003–07). Out of that exposure, she decided to found a local organization called Ethiopian Center for Disability and Development (ECDD) along with other prominent Ethiopians to promote the inclusion of persons with disabilities in different development programmes including economic empowerment. As of 2016, Yetnebersh is working with disability and development NGO LIGHT FOR THE WORLD, which she had previously represented as a member of their International Board of Ambassadors.
In September 2017, Yetnebersh Nigussie was named a joint winner of the Right Livelihood Award, the ""Alternative Nobel Prize"", ""for her inspiring work promoting the rights and inclusion of people with disabilities, allowing them to realise their full potential and changing mindsets in our societies"".  Sharing the honour with Khadija Ismayilova, Colin Gonsalves, and American environmental lawyer Robert Bilott.Inspired by winning the Right Livelihood Award and the Spirit of Helen Keller Award, Yetnebersh Nigussie initiated the ‘Her Abilities Award’ together with Light for the World to honour women with disabilities who achieved greatness in their life and field of work. www.her-abilities-award.org

Williams, Jr. (June 17, 1911–August 21, 1991), known as Dootsie Williams, was an American record producer and record label owner who released early records by Redd Foxx and The Penguins.


== Life and career ==
Williams was born in Mobile, Alabama, in 1911, and by 1918 had moved with his family to Los Angeles. He was a leader of the Harlem Dukes band in the 1940s. While performing at gigs, he came up with the idea of recording other artists.In 1949, Williams founded the Blue Records label.  Two years later he changed the name to Dootone.  One of the first artists he recorded on Dootone was a violinist named Johnny Creach, who years later would become popular as Papa John Creach.  In 1954, he recorded a local group called The Penguins, who would have a huge hit with ""Earth Angel"".While the label would record a wide variety of music, it would be best known for a series of comedy recordings by Redd Foxx. Williams saw the comedian perform at the Brass Rail, a local Los Angeles nightclub, and signed Foxx to a recording contract.  Laff of the Party, the first of many albums that Foxx recorded for Williams, became a cult favorite and helped establish him as a national star.Williams died in Los Angeles on August 21, 1991.

Secondary defenders must now establish their position outside of the zone between the backboard and the front of the rim to draw a charge.
If a player is injured and unable to shoot his own foul shots, the replacement shooter must be chosen from the players currently on the court.
Instant replay may now be used to determine flagrant fouls.

=== NCAA Tournament ===

The NCAA Tournament tipped off on March 16, 2010, with the opening round game in Dayton, Ohio, and concluded on April 5 at the Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. Of the 65 teams that were invited to participate, 31 were automatic bids while 34 were at-large bids. The 34 at-large teams came from 11 conferences, with the Big East receiving the most bids – eight. The tournament was marked by a number of significant upsets. The biggest saw Northern Iowa knock off #1 overall seed Kansas 69–67 on an Ali Farokhmanesh three-pointer in the waning seconds. Another surprise was Ivy League champion Cornell making a surprise run to the Sweet 16 – becoming the first Ivy school to win an NCAA tournament game since 1998.
Duke made a big run in the NCAA tournament, defeating Arkansas Pine-Bluff (73–44), California (68–53), Purdue (70–57), and Baylor (78–72) in their region. In the semifinals, the Blue Devils routed West Virginia 78–57 to make their 10th championship game appearance. In the end, Duke defeated surprise finalist Butler 61–59, after a three-point attempt by the Bulldogs' Gordon Hayward barely missed at the buzzer. Duke claimed its fourth National title as Blue Devil forward Kyle Singler was named Most Outstanding Player

== Plot ==
A street-toughened orphan by the name of Munna (Aamir Khan) is befriended by some kind folks, whose effervescent daughter Mili (Urmila Matondkar) soon grows to be his best buddy. Both gravitate toward the Mumbai movie industry. While Mili finds occupation as a movie extra, Munna earns his livelihood selling movie tickets in the black market.
Mili has ambitions of becoming an actress. Fortune glances her way when she dances her way into a movie star's attention. This actor, Raj Kamal (Jackie Shroff), arranges for her to be auditioned for the heroine's role in his upcoming movie called Rangeela. Mili's shortcomings amount to distractions, but thanks in no small way to Munna and Raj, she lands the role.
Raj and Munna both fall for Mili, but Mili is too busy making the movie to notice any of this. She starts spending a lot of time with Raj during the filming. Munna tries many times to tell Mili that he loves her, but he is unable to, or Raj gets in the way. Eventually, feeling inferior, Munna decides to leave Mili to Raj, who can give her a better life than he can. The matter is not resolved though, as Mili hears of this on the film's opening night. She asks Raj to help her find Munna, which he does after realizing that Mili seems to love Munna and not him.
Mili stops Munna midway, misunderstandings get cleared up and the lovers unite.

Urmila Matondkar became an overnight sensation and a superstar. Her fame and star status were bolstered by hits like ""Tanha Tanha"" and ""Rangeela Re"". The costume designer of the film Manish Malhotra also received instant fame. The film proved to be a turning point for Aamir's career, whose chemistry with Urmila was also appreciated. The choreography of Rangeela also deserves a special mention. The amazing dance sequences led by choreographers Ahmed Khan and Saroj Khan were considered classic and appealing. Rangeela's music was also highly successful that helped the film to achieve victory at the box office.

== Cultural significance ==
Rangeela is considered to be a cult classic in history of Bollywood. The impact of it was so huge that the film was reported to have inspired the 2004 movie Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!.Despite the film's huge success, It was still regarded as a film ahead of its time as the films made during the early 1990s had dated plots and storylines. Shekhar Kapur called it 'The film of the 21st Century with great music and visuals' at the screening of the film. The presentation of Urmila Matondkar in the film became the talk of the town as it re-invented the image of the Bollywood Heroine. Aamir Khan played an unusual character of a Mumbaiya Tapori in the early stages of his career and that proved to be the milestone for him. A. R. Rahman's music of the film became such a rage that it topped the charts for almost a decade. The songs still remain popular as they have a fresh feel. The film established careers of so many technicians and the people who worked behind the camera.

== Life and career ==
Senter was born in Potsdam, New York to David K. and Susan Senter.  Senter was elected to city council from the 1st ward in 1858 and was then elected to mayor in 1859 serving until 1860.  It is assumed, since there is no military record for Senter, that he served in the Civil War as assistant commissary-subsistence officer at Camp Taylor in Cleveland in April and May 1861.  He was promoted to commandant of the camp in 1862 serving until 1864.  When Irvine Masters, mayor of Cleveland, resigned his office in 1864, Senter was elected by city council once again to serve as mayor and finish Masters's term.  Senter retired from political life to practice law and pursue the wine and liquor business.
He died in 1870 and was buried at Woodland Cemetery in Cleveland, Ohio.Senter married Delia Wheaton in 1851 and they had three children:  George B. Senter Jr., Cornelia E., and J. Augusta.

== Life and career ==
Born John Eric Colledge in Tynemouth, Northumberland, Colledge graduated with first class honours in English from Liverpool University (LU) in 1932. He later earned an MA from LU in 1935, and also served as an Assistant Lecturer in LU's Department of English Language and Philology from 1937-1939. One of his influential professors at LU was John Henry Grafton Grattan (15 September 1878 – 22 October 1951). In 1932-1933 he pursued further studies in Munich. As a student in Munich, he personally witnessed the rants of Adolf Hitler.
Colledge was an excellent linguist with mastery of the French, German and Dutch languages. He was recruited by British Intelligence shortly after the outbreak of World War II, and spent the war working on military intelligence for Great Britain. Between 1945 and 1946, he served on the Allied Control Council's committee, which oversaw the restoration of German universities in Berlin. He returned to LU in 1946 as a full Lecturer, and was subsequently appointed Senior Lecturer (1952-1961) and Reader (1961-1963). He lectured on medieval literature and the history of the English language. Many of his students have gone on to chair English departments at universities in the United Kingdom and the United States. In addition to teaching, he also directed and acted in productions with the university's Dramatic Society. Through this interest, he became friends with the actress Patricia Routledge while she was a Liverpool student. She credits Colledge for persuading her to pursue a professional acting career.In 1963, Colledge resigned from his post at LU in order to join the Order of Saint Augustine at Clare Priory in Suffolk. At this time he assumed the religious name of Brother Edmund. He pursued further religious studies in Rome, after which he was ordained a priest in 1967. In 1968, he became an Assistant Professor at the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He was soon after promoted to full Professor at that institution, remaining there through 1977. He then returned to England to join the teaching staff at Austin Friars St Monica's School in Carlisle. He lived his latter years in Kent and died in Deal in 1999 at the age of 89.

== Plot ==
Lucas Marsh is a brilliant and dedicated medical student who has aspired to be a doctor since childhood. His mother is dead and he is estranged from his alcoholic father, who has squandered the family's money, leaving Lucas unable to pay for medical school. In order to get the needed tuition money, Lucas marries older nurse Kristina ""Kris"" Hedvigson, who has substantial savings. Although Kris loves Lucas and helps him in a variety of ways, he is indifferent toward her and considers her ""stupid"" although she is an excellent nurse. Lucas cares only about his medical work and frequently clashes with other doctors whom he considers incompetent, including his wealthy best friend Alfred Boone. Kris, Alfred and Lucas' mentor Dr. Aarons try to humanize him and teach him that all doctors sometimes make mistakes.
Lucas looks down on doctors who focus on making money, and after completing his internship, he accepts a position working with Dr. Dave Runkleman in his busy practice in rural Greenville, where many patients lack the money to pay. Runkleman, who has a life-threatening heart condition, hired Lucas to help with the workload and perhaps take over the practice. Overworked and frustrated with the incompetent head of the local hospital, Lucas has an affair with rich widow Harriet Lang, causing Kris, who is secretly pregnant, to finally leave him. When Runkleman's heart condition flares up, Lucas performs surgery to save his life, but makes a mistake during the surgery and Runkleman dies. Struggling to cope with his failure, Lucas begs Kris to help him, and the two reconcile.

== Reception ==
In a contemporary review for The New York Times, critic Bosley Crowther panned the film, including Kramer's directing and Mitchum's acting: ""The delineator of this exegesis is a stolid young medical man whose personality and fierce determination should make a feature-length study in themselves. And the fact that Mr. Kramer has not managed to force a clear understanding of his man is quite as much a shortcoming of the picture as is the flat performance of Robert Mitchum in the role. ... With so much dissecting in his picture—and so much of it being good—it is too bad that Mr. Kramer couldn't have done a little on his characters.""The Citizen-News praised the film's authenticity: ""There is a fine ring of authenticity to every scene involving the story's medical aspects, and the fast 'shock' clip showing the beating heart of a patient takes you, scalpel in hand, into the surgical center of the hospital."" However, the paper's review was critical of the acting and casting: ""... Bickford's acting was the one bright spot in a set of standard performances. ... [T]he principal roles were miscast, with the exception of Bickford and Miss Graham.""The Los Angeles Times described the film's premiere at the Stanley-Warner Beverly Hills Theatre as ""... truly festive ... with an especially large street crowd, and a mood of celebration that was all prevailing."" The newspaper's critic Edwin Schallert praised the film, calling it ""... one of the strongest dramatic pictures exhibited to the public thus far this year.""


== Release ==
Not as a Stranger earned a worldwide distribution gross of over $8 million, and a profit of $1.8 million. It was United Artists' highest-grossing film at the time.The film was released on Blu-ray disc by Kino Lorber in 2018.

Born in London, in 1835, the son of William Kingdon (a surgeon) and brother to James Durant Kingdon (1830–1899, a priest and headmaster), he was educated at St Paul's School, London and admitted a pensioner at Trinity College, Cambridge on 30 November 1853 (aged 19) and matriculated at Michaelmas 1854. He gained his Bachelor of Arts (BA) in 1858, proceeded Cambridge Master of Arts (MA Cantab) in 1861 and was eventually awarded a Doctor of Divinity (DD) in 1881, around the time of his episcopal ordination.

It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1989 for its architecture as one of the finest surviving 19th-century auditoriums.


== History ==

The Troy Savings Bank was founded in 1823 and moved to its current location in 1870.  In appreciation of the community's support, the plans for the new building called for a music hall to be built on the upper floors.
In the early years of the 20th century the Music Hall featured performances from artists such as Lillian Nordica, Henri Vieuxtemps, Ignace Jan Paderewski, Albert Spalding, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Myra Hess and Jose Iturbi. In the 1930s and 1940s, artists including Vladimir Horowitz, Yehudi Menuhin and Artur Rubinstein played there. It was a usual stop for a musician on a tour around America.
Apparently not up to modern building codes, there was long a tradition that prior to each performance the Fire Marshal would come out on stage and announce ""There is absolutely no smoking in the Hall. If you have to smoke, you can hit the streets at half time.""
Following World War II, Troy's wealth declined and so did the bank's.  Many public initiatives were begun to save the bank (and thus the music hall) from closure. Ideas included establishing an industrial and folk art museum downstairs and renting the Hall itself to the area's many colleges.
In 1979, the Troy Savings Bank Music Hall Revitalization Committee was founded by private citizens.  With the bank's support and additional funding from the city and county for its administration, the Troy Savings Bank Music Hall Corporation was founded. A not-for-profit organization which still leases the Hall from the bank, the corporation began its ownership with a performance by the Benny Goodman Band in 1980. A corporate re-structuring and buyout followed, and, in 1999, the Troy Savings Bank converted to a public corporation. On January 16, 2004, First Niagara Financial Group, Inc. acquired Troy Financial Corporation, the holding company for the Troy Savings Bank, and Troy Commercial Bank. In the fall of 2016, First Niagara merged with Key Bank.
It is a contributing property to the Central Troy Historic District.


== Design ==
George B. Post's design was selected by default: due to his pioneer work in crafting metal to simulate stone in a building's superstructure, it was the only estimate to fall within the board's projected budget. A graduate of New York University, Post studied under Richard Morris Hunt in the mid 1800s and soon became a respected architect in New York City. His preference for the Beaux Arts and French Renaissance styles can be seen in the building's highly detailed decorations. Construction began on the bank's new property on the corner of State and Second Streets in July 1871.
The building was completed in April 1875, at a final cost of $435,000. The result was a massive six story edifice that dominates the surrounding neighborhood. The bank offices comprised about one-third of the first floor; the remainder was rented to area businesses, including at various times an insurance company, the Troy Chamber of Commerce, a bus terminal and a plumbing company. Above this rose the Music Hall: 106 feet long, 69 feet wide and a towering 61 feet high.
Original granite stairs running the width of the building introduced concert-goers to the ornate grandeur of the hall. Box offices to the left and right preceded a center stairway, which led to the hall itself. Parquet and Dress Circle seats were, and still are, reached by using the center staircase. Iron staircases on either side guided the way to the upper and lower boxes, the balcony, and the gallery seating areas. The hall's seating capacity is 1,253, and seating arrangements have never changed. Post designed all of the staircases himself and had them constructed by Architectural Iron Works in New York City.
Intricate frescoes, crafted by another New York City firm, G. Garibaldi, decorated the walls about the stage and ceiling. The frescoes above the stage were covered by the addition of a large tracker action organ in October, 1890.
Most of the original frescoing is still visible, except for the ceiling, where the replacement of the chandelier in 1930 also involved repair work on the ceiling frescoes. The first chandelier was remarkable, with 14,000 hand-cut French prisms catching the light of 260 gas burners, ignited by a single traveling gas jet. In October 1923, it was converted to electric, and later replaced by the chandelier which hangs there today. The rest of the lighting was converted in 1929, following an accident in December 1928, when a ballerina's headdress was ignited by a gas lamp in her dressing room. Consequently, the fire marshal ordered the conversion from gas to electric as a safety precaution. The new frescoes, made in 1930, outlined the rim of the ceiling and exhibited the popular Art Deco styling of the late 1920s in the lettering, featuring the names of great classical composers such as J. S. Bach and Haydn. The chandelier has not been modernized, and still must be raised and lowered by a hand crank.The building was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1989.

		
		
		
		
		
		


== Organ ==

The organ at the Troy Savings Bank Music Hall was built in 1882 as Opus 190 of J. H. & C. S. Odell of Yonkers, New York, and originally installed in the home of New York City financier William Belden.  The original purchase price of the instrument was $12,470.  The Troy Savings Bank purchased the organ from Mr. Belden in 1889 and the instrument was installed in the Music Hall during the months of August through October, 1890.  The first notes from the Odell Opus 190 in the Hall were heard on October 20, 1890.  The organ was maintained in usable condition until the 1960s, at which point it fell into disrepair.
In early 2006, an effort was mounted to restore the organ after decades of neglect. Under the impetus of the Organ Historical Society and  under the direction of organ builder S.L Huntington & Co. of Stonington, Connecticut, a crew of volunteers worked over the course of several weeks to restore the organ to playable condition. The instrument was featured during the Organ Historical Society's 2006 convention.


== Acoustics ==
Factors that contribute to the acoustics include: narrow shoebox form, early sidewall reflections, tall ceiling, seat count of 1180, padded wooden seats, shallow under balcony, thick plaster surfaces, ornamental detailing, organ cove which projects sound. The acoustically sensitive hall is rented for concerts and recordings.

== History ==
Previously the complex was known as Harlem, the Harlem Prison Farm, or the Harlem Plantation. The state of Texas purchased the prison farm property in 1885 or 1886. Previously several private plantations based here used convict leasing for labor. This system has been called ""slavery by another name"", as lessees operated with little oversight by the state as to their treatment of convicts. The plantations included the Harlem Plantation and several adjacent tracts of land. The state essentially assigned room and board to employers who leased convicts; it had few prisons until late in the 19th century.
In 1885 the state opened Harlem I Unit and Harlem II Unit. From July 20, 1888 to August 31, 1907 a post office was located on the prison farm. After the post office closed, the post office in Richmond, Texas handled mail for the prison farm.In 1908 the State of Texas bought the Riddick Plantation, which was next to the Harlem property. The state incorporated that property into the Harlem Farm.In September 1913 several prison guards in one of the units punished twelve African-American prisoners by placing them in a 9 feet 3 inches (2.82 m) long, 7 feet 3.5 inches (2.223 m) wide, and 6 feet 11.5 inches (2.121 m) high enclosure called ""The Hole."" The temperature in the enclosure went over 100 °F (38 °C), and convicts asked the guards to let them out. The guards did not let them out, and 8 of the 12 convicts died of suffocation and heat.In 1925 the prison farm had 5,005 acres (2,025 ha) of land. During that year it had 260 prisoners. The complex was renamed in the 1950s after Governor of Texas Beauford H. Jester.A spur track of the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway opened at the prison farm to load and unload sugarcane that was produced at the farm. The railroad line closed in 1929.The state expanded the facilities, opening Jester III Unit in July 1982. Jester IV Unit opened in November 1993.


== Representation in other media ==
Steven Spielberg's first theatrical release, The Sugarland Express (1974), was set in and partially filmed at the prison.

Padé approximant,"['All articles needing additional references', 'Articles containing French-language text', 'Articles containing German-language text', 'Articles needing additional references from October 2021', 'Articles needing additional references from September 2018', 'Articles with short description', 'Continued fractions', 'Numerical analysis', 'Rational functions', 'Short description matches Wikidata']","In mathematics, a Padé approximant is the ""best"" approximation of a function by a rational function of given order. Under this technique, the approximant's power series agrees with the power series of the function it is approximating.  The technique was developed around 1890 by Henri Padé, but goes back to Georg Frobenius, who introduced the idea and investigated the features of rational approximations of power series.
The Padé approximant often gives better approximation of the function than truncating its Taylor series, and it may still work where the Taylor series does not converge. For these reasons Padé approximants are used extensively in computer calculations. They have also been used as auxiliary functions in Diophantine approximation and transcendental number theory, though for sharp results ad hoc methods— in some sense inspired by the Padé theory— typically replace them. Since Padé approximant is a rational function, an artificial singular point may occur as an approximation, but this can be avoided by Borel–Padé analysis.
The reason why the Padé approximant tends to be a better approximation than a truncating Taylor series is clear from the viewpoint of the multi-point summation method. Since there are many cases in which the asymptotic expansion at infinity becomes 0 or a constant, it can be interpreted as the ""incomplete two-point Padé approximation"", in which the ordinary Padé approximation improves the method truncating a Taylor series.

  The Padé approximant is unique for given m and n, that is, the coefficients

            0

    {\displaystyle a_{0},a_{1},\dots ,a_{m},b_{1},\dots ,b_{n}}
   can be uniquely determined. It is for reasons of uniqueness that the zero-order term at the denominator of 
  
    
      
        R
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle R(x)}
   was chosen to be 1, otherwise the numerator and denominator of 
  
    
      
        R
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle R(x)}
   would have been unique only up to multiplication by a constant.
The Padé approximant defined above is also denoted as

  
    
      
        [
        m
        
          /

For given x, Padé approximants can be computed by Wynn's epsilon algorithm and also other sequence transformations from the partial sums

        x
        )
        =
        
          c
          
            0
          
        
        +

    {\displaystyle T_{N}(x)=c_{0}+c_{1}x+c_{2}x^{2}+\cdots +c_{N}x^{N}}
  of the Taylor series of f, i.e., we have

  
    
      
        
          c
          
            k

                f
                
                  (
                  k
                  )
                
              
              (
              0
              )
            
            
              k
              !
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle c_{k}={\frac {f^{(k)}(0)}{k!}}.}
  f can also be a formal power series, and, hence, Padé approximants can also be applied to the summation of divergent series.
One way to compute a Padé approximant is via the extended Euclidean algorithm for the polynomial greatest common divisor. The relation

    {\displaystyle R(x)=P(x)/Q(x)=T_{m+n}(x){\text{ mod }}x^{m+n+1}}
  is equivalent to the existence of some factor 
  
    
      
        K
        (
        x
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle K(x)}
   such that

  
    
      
        P
        (

        )

            n

        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle P(x)=Q(x)T_{m+n}(x)+K(x)x^{m+n+1},}
  which can be interpreted as the Bézout identity of one step in the computation of the extended greatest common divisor of the polynomials 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            m

    {\displaystyle T_{m+n}(x)}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            m

== DLog Padé method ==
Padé approximants can be used to extract critical points and exponents of functions. In thermodynamics, if a function f(x) behaves in a non-analytic way near a point x = r like 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        x
        )
        ∼
        
          |
        
        x
        −
        r
        
          
            |
          
          
            p
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(x)\sim |x-r|^{p}}
  , one calls x = r a critical point and p the associated critical exponent of f. If sufficient terms of the series expansion of f are known, one can approximately extract the critical points and the critical exponents from respectively the poles and residues of the Padé approximants 
  
    
      
        [
        n

    {\displaystyle [n/n+1]_{g}(x)}
  , where

        =

== Generalizations ==
A Padé approximant approximates a function in one variable.  An approximant in two variables is called a Chisholm approximant (after J. S. R. Chisholm), in multiple variables a Canterbury approximant (after Graves-Morris at the University of Kent).


== Two-points Padé approximant ==
The conventional Padé approximation is determined to reproduce the Maclaurin expansion up to a given order. Therefore, the approximation at the value apart from the expansion point may be poor. This is avoided by the 2-point Padé approximation, which is a type of multipoint summation method. At

    {\displaystyle x\to \infty }
  , where the accuracy of the approximation may be the worst in the ordinary Pade approximation, good accuracy of the 2-point Pade approximant is guaranteed. Therefore, the 2-point Pade approximant can be a method that gives a good approximation globally for

  . There is a method of using this to give an approximate solution of a differential equation with high accuracy. Also, for the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function, the first nontrivial zero can be estimated with some accuracy from the asymptotic behavior on the real axis.

Its population in 2014 was 73,512.

","El Hamma (Arabic: الحامة Al Ḥāmmah) is an oasis town located in the Gabès Governorate, 30 kilometers west of Gabès, Tunisia and near the eastern end of Chott el Fejej. Its population in 2014 was 73,512.


== Etymology ==
The Arabic name ( حامة ) comes from the word for ""hot water"" ( الماء الحام ), an reference to the thermal springs that are widespread in the region. The similar names Hamma or Hammamet (the spas) are given to other towns and villages across North Africa.


== Geography ==
Located along the Gabès-Kébili road, and at an altitude of about fifty meters, the town borders the Chott el-Fejej. It is one of the natural outlets of the great Albian Aquifer. The oasis has several sources which together form the El Hamma ouads which are 300 meters from each other. Among these are Aïn El Bordj, Aïn Chaaliya and Aïn Abdelkader.
A small mountain range 220 meters above sea level separates El Hamma from the Gabès.


== History ==
The town is in the ancestral lands of the Beni Zid tribe and their neighbors the Matmata tribes.
The Matmata (Berber: Imatmaten, Arabic: مطماطة) are a tribal confederation of Berber tribes, specifically Beni Faten, living mainly between Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco. The ancestor of Matmata is called Maskab and nicknamed Matmat. In ancient times the Matmata inhabited the plateaus of Mindas, around Ouancherich (current Ouarsenis), and Mount Guezoul Tiaret and the great interior plains of Tunisia today. They became powerful at the beginning of the eleventh century, and actively participated in the war between Hammad ibn Bologhine and Badis Ibn El Mansour.

Leo d'African visited El Hamma in the mid-sixteenth century noting that ""It evokes the extremely hot spring that flows a mile and a half from the city and forms the stream that runs through the city in its middle in wide canals.""

		
The English explorer Dr. Thomas Shaw who, as early as 1743, spoke of the city in these terms:

""The city of El Hamma is four leagues west of Gabes: the Tunisians have a small fort and a garrison because it is one of their border places [...] There are several baths, which each have a roof covered with straw, and in their basins, which are about twelve feet square and four deep, there is, for the convenience of those who bathe, stone benches a little to below the surface of the water.""
Victor Guérin described the town in 1862 ""At one o'clock, we arrive at El Hamma. This oasis is made up of several villages, which are: El Kasr, the most important of all, Dabdaba, where we ask hospitality to Sheikh, Soumbat, Zaouïet El Madjeba and Bou Atouche. Palm plantations watered by running water surround these villages. These waters come from four hot springs, three of which are in Dabdaba and the fourth between Dabdaba and El Kasr. They were formerly enclosed in basins built in very beautiful cut stones and still exist, at least in part, because many blocks have been moved or removed. To each of these basins is attached a small bathhouse of modern construction but divided internally into several compartments that are ancient. The temperature of these sources varies: the hottest is forty-five degrees centigrade, the lowest is thirty-four degrees centigrade. Between Dabdaba and El Kasr once stretched a town called Aqua Tacapitanae, because it depended on Tacape, from which it was separated by an interval of 18 Roman miles. It is mentioned in the Route of Antonin. It is now completely destroyed and its debris has been used to build the modern villages that have succeeded it and a fort called Bordj El Hamma""
At the end of the 19th century, André Martel, estimated Beni Zid tribe had nearly 19,000 inhabitants, a quarter of whom permanently reside in the oasis of El Hamma. today a majority most of the Beni Zid are settled permanently in the Oasis.
On 29 March 1943, New Zealand and British forced defeated the Germans at the Battle of the Mareth Line and entered El Hamma.
The completion of several deep bore holes to supply water to the Gabès cement plant in the 1980s and 1990s, saw a drying up of several hot springs including Aïn Echoffa, and a degradation of the palm grove farms.


== Economy ==
Agriculture has long been the main economic sector of activity in Hammah, the city's economy has diversified in recent years and the industry employs more than a third of the towns assets.The hotel and tourism sector is also experiencing particularly significant growth thanks to a rehabilitation program co-financed by the World Bank.


== Trivia ==
The Swiss singer-songwriter Mani Matter has brought the town of El Hamma to the knowledge of most German speaking Swiss with a song about a ""Sidi abdel Assar"" who allegedly lived there. However a search by the Swiss television for the real person behind the song in 2008 yielded no results.

== Gameplay ==

Wardner is a side-scrolling action-platform game similar to Ghosts 'n Goblins and Rastan where the players takes control of Dover, the main protagonist through five stages (six in the Genesis version) of varying themes set in a fantasy land, with the main objective being rescuing his girlfriend Mia from the titular antagonist by defeating his servants, some of which that act as a boss at the end of the stage in order to progress further on the journey.Some of the levels featured are linear in nature, populated with obstacles and enemies, requiring the player to traverse the stage by running, jumping, climbing, shooting or dodging enemies, while other levels that are featured later in the game become more maze-like and exploratory, making the player take different routes to reach the end. Along the way, gold orbs can be picked up by defeating enemies to increase the player character's firepower, as well as money that is used in shops at the end of each stage to acquire protective items and new attacks, though some of them can also be obtained during the level.
The game hosts a number of hidden bonus secrets to be found on certain setpieces within the scenery, which is also crucial for reaching high-scores to obtain extra lives. The title uses a checkpoint system in which a downed single player will respawn at the beginning of the checkpoint they managed to reach before dying. Getting hit by enemy fire, colliding against solid stage obstacles, falling off the stage or running out of time will result in losing a live and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless the players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing.


== Development and release ==
Wardner was released on arcades worldwide by Taito in 1987, while the North American version was distributed under the name Pyros. Osamu Ōta served as composer for the title's soundtrack under the alias ""Ree"" in one of his first roles on the video game industry prior to Twin Hawk and Snow Bros.. Former Toaplan composer Masahiro Yuge stated in a 2012 interview with Japanese publications Shooting Gameside that Ōta joined the company when their staff was small, while Tatsuya Uemura stated in a 2009 interview that the project was created by Etsuhiro Wada and was also influenced by Wizardry. On 25 June 1989, an album containing music from the title and other Toaplan games was published exclusively in Japan by Datam Polystar.On 25 March 1988, a port of Wardner developed by Daiei Seisakusho was released exclusively in Japan for the Famicom Disk System by Taito. A version for the Nintendo Entertainment System was developed and planned to be published by Sammy in North America under the name Pyross. Despite being showcased to the public during the Summer Consumer Electronics Show 1990, this version of the game was never officially released for unknown reasons.On 26 April 1991, a reworked port of the game was developed for the Sega Genesis by Dragnet and first released in Japan by Visco Corporation under the name Wardner no Mori Special, while a North American release by Mentrix Software occurred later on May of the same year. In 1988, a version for the PC Engine was announced to be in development by NEC Avenue under the helm of  Prototype founder Toshio Tabeta and despite being previewed, the project was then moved on to the PC Engine CD-ROM² and ultimately to the PC Engine Super CD-ROM² before being cancelled after multiple delays, despite work on the port being completed.In 2019, Japanese company M2 announced that in 2020 they will release every game by Toaplan (excluding Mahjong Sisters and Enma Daiō) for consoles in Japan including Wardner. In 2022, both the arcade and the Famicom Disk System versions will be included in the Hishou Same! Same! Same! compilation for Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 as part of M2's Toaplan Arcade Garage label as downloadable content.


== Reception and legacy ==

In Japan, Game Machine listed Wardner on their November 1, 1987 issue as being the ninth most-successful table arcade unit of the month, outperforming titles such as Arkanoid: Revenge of Doh and Black Tiger. Wardner was met with positive reception from critics since its release in the arcades and compared the game with Ghosts 'n Goblins by Capcom. Mike Pattenden of Commodore User praised the presentation, visuals and challenge. Clare Edgeley of Computer and Video Games gave positive remarks to the gameplay and level design. Likewise, both Robin Hogg and Cameron Pound from The Games Machine commended the visuals, action and gameplay. Although Crash's Steve Jarratt and Julian Rignall noted its lack of originality, they praised the gameplay. Den of Geek, however, regarded it to be a solid but forgettable title from Toaplan.Wardner was received with a more mixed reception on Sega Genesis from reviewers. In their respective retrospective review, gaming website HonestGamers felt mixed about the Genesis port.In more recent years, the rights to the game and many other IPs from Toaplan are now owned by Tatsujin, a company named after Truxton's Japanese title that was founded in 2017 by Yuge, who are now affiliated with arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia.

It is difficult to determine the exact age of Stumperlowe Cottage, various sources give conflicting dates for its construction and it is possible that the cottage and the cruck barn were constructed at different times. Local historian Bessie Bunker, author of the book “Cruck Buildings” states that the ancient cruck building dates from around 1400. Bunker considered the cottage to be the original Stumperlowe Hall, and was later downgraded to become a labourers cottage and attached barn when the new hall was built in the 1650s by Robert Hall. In the 15th century the cottage stood in a completely rural situation with the ancient track between Ecclesall and Hallam Head passing in front of the building, however this was built over in Victorian times as was the farms extensive lands.


=== Modern times ===
The cottage was in a ruinous state in 1968 when the last resident of the old building moved out (photograph on Picture Sheffield), the barn had lost its roof and the cruck timbers were open to the elements, the walls were held up by wooden props. Demolition of the ancient cottage seemed certain, however it was saved and protected when it was made a Grade II listed building in September 1970. The cottage was eventually purchased by Mr. & Mrs. D. Millar who were living next door, the Millars took seven years to renovate the building and moved in at Christmas 1993.


== Architecture ==
During the restoration the barns walls were completely rebuilt in coursed rubble while the cottage section at the western end was rendered and colourwashed. The remaining four cruck frames are still in place and can be seen internally. The barn is a now a large open plan living space. There is a continuous stone slate roof to the whole building, a 19th-century through-eaves box dormer window was removed from the cottage front during restoration.

== History ==
Attempts were made to establish a municipal corporation at Kolkata from the middle of the 19th century. The electoral system was introduced for the first time in 1847, and 4 of the 7 board members were elected by the rate payers. In 1852 the board was replaced by a new one and in 1863 a new body was formed. As per old records, in 1872 there were 25 wards in Kolkata (spellings as in use at that time) – 1. Shyampukur, 2. Kumartuli, 3. Bartala, 4. Sukea Street, 5. Jorabagan, 6. Jorasanko, 7. Barabazar, 8. Kolutola, 9. Muchipara, 10. Boubazar, 11. Padmapukur, 12. Waterloo Street, 13. Fenwick Bazar, 14. Taltala, 15.

A new municipal corporation was created in 1876, wherein 48 commissioners were elected and 24 were appointed by the government.

She was born in Corfu on November 12, 1809 or, according to another theory, on September 27, 1811, daughter of the Souliote chieftain Photos Tzavelas and sister of the Greek War of Independence fighter and later prime minister of Greece, Kitsos Tzavelas. It is said that on the day when she was born, her father was poisoned by Ali Pasha’s agents and she therefore took her name from him.

She there married, during the next year, to Theodoros Kolokotronis’s son Gennaios. Among the wedding gifts she received, were a pair of bracelets, offered by Ioannis Kapodistrias, governor of Greece. This marriage signalled among other things the political alliance between the Tzavelas and Kolokotronis clans.During the reign of King Otto, Photini Kolokotroni became lady in waiting at the royal court and a personal councillor to Queen Amalia. With Ioannis Kolokotronis she had seven children: two sons, Theodoros (alias Phalez) and Konstantinos, as well as five daughters, Georgitsa Petimeza, Aikaterini Rodiou, Eleni Zotou, Zoitsa Manotou and Efrosyni, who remained unmarried.
She died in Athens on September 26, 1890 after a long and painful disease. Her funeral took place on the next day in the church of Agios Georgios in Athens.

== Critical reception ==
Luvanmusiq received positive reviews from music critics. AllMusic editor Andy Kellman gave note of the record's short running time allowing equal attention for each track and the overall throwback aesthetic being the same as Musiq's previous efforts and not containing ""insincere trend-hopping or ill-fitting collaborations with hot MCs."" He concluded that ""[T]hey're neither raunchy nor drab, and they're nearly a lost art form in 2007."" DJBooth's Nathan Slavik gave praise to the musicianship feeling mature throughout the record's track list of slow jams and crowd pleasers, despite the former's combination of lush minimalism and sincere lyricism coming across as ""background music."" He concluded that, ""If Musiq’s sole intention for this album was to remind us he’s alive, mission accomplished. Luvanmusiq has several solid tracks, and a couple excellent ones, but as a whole it falls just short of excellent."" Mark Edward Nero from About.com gave a mixed review of the album, commending Musiq for remaining consistent in terms of his ""soft, deliberate vocal style"" and penchant for romantic ballads but felt that it comes across as though he's shown ""little creative growth as a singer."" He highlighted the tracks ""Betterman"", ""Makeyouhappy"" and ""Ridiculous"" for having enough content to stand alongside the first single ""B.U.D.D.Y."" and showcasing Musiq's continued talent as ""one of the better R&B songwriters in the business today"", concluding that ""Although Luvanmusiq rates pretty low in the excitement and thrills departments, if you take the time to listen to it repeatedly, it's an album whose subtle romantic charm grows on you.""

== History ==
Originally part of the Manor of Whitehorse, bought in 1787 by John Cator and enclosed in 1797, Grangewood was known as Whitehorse Wood and formed part of the Great North Wood (Norwood). It was 80 acres (320,000 m2) in extent and was owned by Bishops of London between 1299 and 1338. It became known as White Horse in 1368 when the manor became owned by Walter Whitehors, who was shield-bearer to Edward III (previously it was known as Benchesham Manor).
When Cator died in 1806, the estate was inherited by his nephew, also John Cator, who sold it to a John Davidson Smith.
In 1800, the wood was surrounded by fields and the nearest dwellings were cottages clustered around the farmhouse. By 1847, a track had been constructed across the wood to connect Beulah Spa (laid out by Davidson Smith) with the road junction at White Horse Farm. This formed the line of Grange Road.
Davidson Smith divided the Whitehorse Estate into smaller plots and sold them for development. The east and west sides of Whitehorse Wood were cleared before 1850 and the remaining 30 acres (120,000 m2) to the east of Grange Road were developed as a private estate.
An early edition of the 6"" Ordnance Survey Map shows the layout of the private estate. The mansion was in the centre, with stables between it and the main entrance. To the east of the house, there was a nursery and Ross Lodge, and there was a second lodge at the entrance (Wharncliffe Lodge). Heath Lodge, which stands at the southern end of the park, is not shown on the map; it was built at a later date possibly when a second entrance was made at the junction of Grange Road and Ross Road.
The mansion had gardens that ran south from the house. Near Grange Road, there was a pond with a rustic bridge. The northern end remained woodland with trees on each side of the garden.
The Corporation of Croydon bought the Park for the public in 1900. The Council built a bowling green, tennis courts and a bandstand. Concerts were held during the summer but their popularity declined and the stand was subsequently demolished.
The mansion was a two-storey Victorian building with bay windows, a veranda and a conservatory on the south-east corner. Following purchase by the Corporation the mansion was used as a museum housing a collection of corals, shells and local Roman antiquities. One room was set aside as  'the Veterans' Club' where local pensioners could meet and socialise. Visitor refreshments were available from the tea-room in the house.
The Corporation used the nursery for plant production; in the autumn the greenhouses were open to the public. During the Second World War, it was given over to food production. After the war, it was partly demolished to make room for tennis courts, and in the mid-1960s it was closed when the Borough central nursery was opened.
The mansion was used during the First World War for billeting Canadian troops and in the Second World War both the house and grounds were badly damaged.
The mansion was demolished in 1960, having fallen into poor condition. The foundations were laid out as a formal garden with the bay windows as flower beds.
The park is still a popular area for its oak woodland, gardens, sports facilities and playground and in the spring the steep bank beside Grange Road provides a display of daffodils.

He is remembered for leading a Mormon faction called the Church of Zion, better known as the ""Godbeites"".","William Samuel Godbe (June 26, 1833 – August 1, 1902) was a British convert to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He is remembered for leading a Mormon faction called the Church of Zion, better known as the ""Godbeites"".


== Biography ==
Godbe was born in Middlesex, England, to Samuel Godbe, a music professor, and Sarah LaRiviere, a descendant of French Huguenots. Godbe was one of at least five children, and his father died when he was eleven. Godbe's uncle Daniel Grant, an engineer, took him in and taught the boy elements of his trade. Godbe was attracted to classics and travel literature, and by his early teens Godbe earned a living on the sea.
By 1850, Godbe was an experienced sailor who had traveled Western Europe, visited Constantinople, and the shores of Brazil and Africa. Godbe then became bound to a captain who, after retiring from the sea, worked the dock at Kingston upon Hull. In Hull, Godbe encountered Parley P. Pratt, an LDS missionary. By June 1850, Godbe was baptized, against the counsel of his immediate family.
Like most converts, Godbe emigrated to the LDS Church's headquarters in territorial Utah. As a seaman, he worked his way to New York City, then purchased his way by ferry from Albany to Chicago in 1851. From there Godbe walked to Kanesville, Iowa (now Council Bluffs). Too late to join an immigrant company, Godbe traveled with merchant Thomas S. Williams, who was bringing goods west. Godbe arrived in Salt Lake City the final week of October 1851.
Godbe kept his ties with Williams and was offered employment by the successful merchant. In the early 1850s, Godbe was dispatched to San Francisco, California, acting as Williams' agent and perhaps forming ties with John M. Horner, a Mormon businessman in the city. In 1854, Godbe traveled east with Williams' express mail entrepreneur Ben Holladay, returning with 22 wagons of merchandise to start his own sundry and drug store, supposedly the first between the Missouri River and San Francisco. Godbe's business sense propelled him to be in the upper 5% of Utah Territory income, with total assets of over $300,000 by 1870.


== Formation of The Church of Zion ==
In 1868, Godbe and other Mormon merchants began criticizing the economic demands and policies of Brigham Young in Utah Magazine, a periodical that would eventually become The Salt Lake Tribune. That same year, Godbe traveled with his friend (architect, publisher, and fellow Latter-day Saint) Elias L. T. Harrison on an extended business trip to New York. At the time, both men were beginning to question their beliefs in the LDS Church, especially the idea that the church's president (whom members looked to as God's prophet on earth) was infallible.In New York, the two men began attending séances in the hopes of obtaining wisdom and direction from former LDS leaders such as Joseph Smith and Heber C. Kimball who had died. Through the services of a spiritual medium, the men claimed to receive visitations from both Joseph Smith and Heber C. Kimball; also Peter, James, John, and Solomon from the Bible; and finally the German naturalist Alexander Humboldt. The spirits of Smith and Kimball apparently instructed Godbe and Harrison to reform the LDS Church, while the spirit of Humboldt told the two men he had important information for them that would revolutionize the world's understanding of evolution (a common theme of 19th Century Spiritualism).Upon returning to Salt Lake, the two men intensified their criticism of the LDS Church in Utah Magazine. On October 25, 1869, they were called before a council of Mormon leaders and tried for apostasy. Brigham Young reportedly gave Godbe the option of selecting his own jury, including one consisting entirely of women and children, if he so desired. Godbe refused the offer, claiming that the composition of the jury would unlikely affect the trial's outcome. At the conclusion of the trial, Godbe and Harrison were excommunicated from the church.Later known as the ""Godbeites"", Godbe and several of his followers soon formed The Church of Zion. Initially the new church based its practices around traditional LDS doctrines, with the intention of reforming those practices and policies that Godbe felt were incorrect. Many of the church's new members became disenfranchised, however, when Godbe and Harrison attempted to modify those doctrines to accommodate tenets of Spiritualism. By the 1880s, Godbe's church had ceased to exist.


== Formation of Liberal Party of Utah ==
At the same time, Godbe believed that political reform—namely breaking Brigham Young's control over secular matters in the territory—could help spur religious reform. Thus, in February, 1870, Godbe helped found the Liberal Party of Utah to oppose LDS candidates in political elections. The party, however, fell out of Godbeite control, and became increasingly anti-Mormon instead of reform-minded.
Godbe, pressured in retail by LDS-backed businesses like Zion's Co-operative Mercantile Institution, began running out of liquid assets by 1871 when he had to sell a mine claim near Ophir, Utah to repay his debts. Other mining ventures failed to produce profits until he organized a high-volume silver mine in 1885. This investment turned to naught in 1892 when the worldwide silver crisis hit.
In 1899, he was the Populist Party candidate for mayor of Salt Lake City. Although without illusions of winning the election, he enjoyed entering progressive politics again.
Godbe remained in Salt Lake City in spite of being a social outcast both from Latter-day Saints and from non-Mormons alarmed with his continued practice of polygamy. After the death of Brigham Young in 1877 he wrote, ""I think I will reside permanently in Salt Lake, it is pleasant for me there, now.""
With failing health, in the summer of 1902 Godbe moved up into nearby Brighton to escape the heat in Salt Lake Valley.

== Background ==
In 2017, Chicago Public Radio program This American Life aired an episode called “We Are in the Future” dealing with Afrofuturism, a cultural aesthetic, philosophy of science and philosophy of history that explores the developing intersection of African diaspora culture with technology. Show producer Neil Drumming also commissioned a song for the episode called “The Deep” from hip-hop group clipping. According to the group, ""The Deep"" is an homage to Acid/Techno duo Drexciya, residing in the same mythological universe created for their music: ""All of their records refer to a utopian underwater civilization founded by African mothers thrown overboard from slave ships. It’s like if Wakanda were Atlantis. We mashed that up with a few details from Parliament’s Motor Booty Affair album, as if they and Drexiya were writing about two different aspects of the same place.""Saga Press senior editor Navah Wolfe became ""transfixed"" by the ""stories that need to be told"" in the album clipping. put out a short time later, which led to a Hugo Award nomination for Best Dramatic Presentation (short form). With the trio's blessings, she set out to find a writer to bring the story to life. She found the voice she was looking for in Rivers Solomon, who was already interested in much of what was in the material, including ""diaspora and slavery, ecological devastation, memory and remembrance"", the lyrics evoking African women drowned on the journey across the sea, of climate change and environmental destruction, of the passion of the ancestors and drive of the survivors:
Our mothers were pregnant African women thrown overboard while / crossing the Atlantic Ocean on slave ships. We were born / breathing water as we did in the womb. We built our home on the / seafloor, unaware of the two-legged surface dwellers until / their world came to destroy ours. With cannons, they searched / for oil beneath our cities. Their greed and recklessness forced / our uprising. Tonight, we remember.
Solomon found the existing outline of the story well-suited for novel form, but still had to develop a main character to carry the story, with a unique voice and back story. This became Yetu, the protagonist, memory-keeper of her people. clipping. members Daveed Diggs, William Hutson and Jonathan Snipes were involved with the books development throughout, and are listed as co-authors. Daveed Diggs narrates the audiobook.


== Plot synopsis ==
The wajinru, are water-breathing merfolk, the descendants of thousands of pregnant African slave women thrown overboard from slave ships crossing the Atlantic. The women drowned, but their babies survived, and eventually developed into their current form. They have built their own idyllic underwater society. Only one person—Yetu, the historian—holds all their often-traumatic memories, so the rest are spared the pain. The historian must suppress all their own personality and desire, and only once a year, the entire community relives the memories together.
The burden she carries threatens to destroy Yetu, so she flees to the surface, finding herself trapped in a tidal pool, and somehow able to breathe air. Here, she meets some of the dreaded ""two-legs"", and in particular, Oori, who is also, in her own way, a memory-keeper of her people. Oori brings Yetu fish to eat, and the two develop a bond. Yetu comes to realize that not all the two-legs are white slave traders. It becomes clear, however, that the surface-dwellers are yet again a threat to the survival of the wajinru, as energy companies desire the fossil fuels lying below the ocean bed: ""Below us, deep beneath the sand, there is a substance they crave. It is their life force. They feast on it like blood.""
The wajinru must strike back at those threatening to destroy them, and wreak havoc on the environment.


== Reception ==
Reviewing for NPR, Jason Heller calls The Deep ""immersive, gut-wrenching, and poetic"". He notes that the unique composition of music, poetry and prose from various creators that is The Deep is more typical of television and film, but that it works remarkably well in this case. Heller concludes: ""For all its complexity in origin and concept, The Deep is an elegantly concise and simple novel. Yetu's plight is an essential, emotionally fraught conflict between duty and sacrifice, between tradition and progress, between the individual and the common good, and between vengeance and forgiveness. Furthermore, enjoying the story doesn't require any foreknowledge of clipping., Drexciya, or the mythology of the wajinru that precedes it; while those elements certainly enrich the novel, Solomon's text stands alone as a wise, daring, touching, and important addition to the Afrofuturist canon, and one that carries its own rhythmic and melodic grace — not to mention a wholly relevant and righteous gravity.""In a starred review, Publishers Weekly enumerates the creative iterations built upon the historical drowning of pregnant African women by white slavers, beginning with Drexciya's imagining of the infants surviving as a community of merfolk, leading to the rap recounting of conflict between the people of the sea and the people of the land, though Solomon's development of a novel with individual characters and deeper exploration of the larger themes, with prose ""that is by turns meditative, didactic, and rawly angry"". The review raves that Solomon interrogates the devastations of slavery without ever showing a white perspective, in a tour de force reorientation of the storytelling gaze. This superb, multilayered work will speak to any empathetic reader, and be best appreciated by those steeped in its cultural and artistic context.In Locus Magazine, Gary K. Wolf analyzes the suitability of representing the horrors of the Middle Passage that are at the root of The Deep, along with other historic catastrophes such as the Holocaust and indigenous genocides, in the fantasy genre, saying that they ""seem to both demand and resist fantasy: on the one hand, the imagination needed to even approximate it in fiction requires resources beyond those of realistic or historical fiction, while on the other, invoking the tools of SF or fantasy risks turning historical outrage into comforting myth."" He notes that while some Holocaust survivors claim that personal testimony is the only appropriate representation, in the case of African women drowned hundreds of years ago there can be no testimony only imagination. He then rates Solomon's depiction as ""a powerful combination of anguish and hope"", He concludes: ""As bleak as the history of the wajinru may be, and as challenging as the new threats from above may seem, Solomon manages to end the novel on a surprisingly hopeful note, in the form of Yetu and Oori’s unlikely romance. When Yetu promises her that “we will make a new thing,” it doesn't really do much to assuage the weight of nightmare histories, but it's something."" Review partner Ian Mond concurs, writing ""The Deep is a beautifully written, thoughtful novella, one, that as Diggs says in his afterword, is over far too quickly.""In the Tor.com review, Alex Brown describes The Deep as ""Afrofuturism with a folklore twist"", concluding that its ""slim page count disguises the depth of the work within. Rivers Solomon conjures a vast world... one where history and present day collide and love can change lives. The text is ever-changing as the ocean itself. Shifting from third person to first person plural, at times it feels as lyrical as the song from whence it came. The story unbalances and redefines. It will trail in your wake long after you finish it. Yetu is a force to behold, and I for one am immensely grateful that Solomon allowed us to witness her story.""Booklist's starred review states that ""Solomon’s beautiful novella weaves together a moving and evocative narrative that imagines a future created from the scars of the past. Highly recommended for those interested in sf or fantasy that draws upon the legacies of colonialism and racism to imagine different, exciting types of futures"". In a generally positive review, Book Reporter's review adds that The Deep is ""a challenging read, unique in its telling and provocative in its themes. Solomon’s prose is powerful and delicate—a poetic and insightful examination of violence, racism, pain, memory and identity.""

== Racing Career ==
Tarzino first raced at Pakenham on 5 July 2015, finishing 3rd and winning $1400. After a trial, Tarzino had his first win on 27 August 2015, coming from 5th at the 400m mark to win by a head. Three weeks later, Tarzino stepped up to 1600 metres at Caulfield, coming from last for a ""huge win"".On 10 October 2015, Tarzino contested the Group 1 Caulfield Guineas. Finishing 7th of 16, it was described as a, ""huge run from this big long-strider threading through the field from well back."" His next appearance was a 3rd in the Moonee Valley Vase, with jockey Craig Newitt saying, ""He jumped and wanted to get rolling a bit in the first furlong but after we'd gone out of the straight, he just dropped the bridle.

Three weeks later, Tarzino finished 2nd in the Australian Guineas behind Palentino, but the decision was protested, with jockey Craig Newitt claiming interference with 600 metres remaining and again in the straight. The protest was dismissed, with stewards saying Tarzino had also rolled towards the opposing horse.On 19 March, Tarzino had a ""dominant win"" in the Group 1 Rosehill Guineas. Newitt said, ""He toyed with them today, all we were waiting on was a gap and when it came there was no stopping him."" Price concluded, ""He’s just a really, really good horse. He never runs a bad race and when he gets the right conditions is very hard to beat."" He than ran a 4th in the Australian Derby, starting as odds-on favourite, before being spelled.Returning on 27 August 2016, Tarzino contested four Group 1 races over the next 6 weeks, failing to finish any better than 6th.


== Stud career ==
Tarzino was retired to stud after ligament injury was discovered that was thought to have effected his last campaign.Tarzino stood at Westbury Stud, Karaka. His 2018 stud fee was $15,000.
In 2021 his fee at Westbury Stud was $12,000.

Isopeptide bond,"['Articles with short description', 'Chemical bonding', 'Protein structure', 'Short description matches Wikidata']","An isopeptide bond is an amide bond that can form for example between a carboxyl group of one amino acid and an amino group of another. At least one of these joining groups is part of the side chain of one of these amino acids, unlike in a peptide bond which is sometimes called an eupeptide bond, especially when discussing about both of these bond types in the same context to make a distinction between the two.
Lysine for example has an amino group on its side chain and glutamic acid has a carboxyl group on its side chain. These amino acids among other similar amino acids may join together or with some other amino acids to form an isopeptide bond.
Isopeptide bond may also form between a γ-carboxamide group ( −(C=O)NH2 ) of glutamine and primary amine ( RNH2 ) of some amino acid as follows
Gln−(C=O)NH2 + RNH2 → Gln−(C=O)NH−R + NH3Bond formation can be either enzyme catalyzed, as in the case for the isopeptide bond formed between lysine and glutamine catalyzed by transglutaminases (their reaction is similar to the reaction above), or it can form spontaneously as observed in HK97 bacteriophage capsid formation and Gram-positive bacterial pili. Spontaneous isopeptide bond formation requires the presence of another residue, glutamic acid, which catalyzes bond formation in a proximity induced manner.An example of a small peptide containing an isopeptide bond is glutathione, which has a bond between the side chain of a glutamate residue and the amino group of a cysteine residue.

== Biosignaling and biostructural roles ==
The function of enzyme generated isopeptide bonds can be roughly divided into two separate categories; signaling and structure. In the case of the former these can be a wide range of functions, influencing protein function, chromatin condensation, or protein half-life. With regard to the latter category, isopeptides can play a role in a variety of structural aspects, from helping to form the clots in wound healing, roles in extra cellular matrix upkeep & apoptosis pathway, roles in the formation of pathogenic pilin, restructuring of the actin skeleton of a host cell to help in the pathogenecity of V. cholerae, and modifying the properties micro-tubilin to influence its role in the structure of a cell.The chemistry involved in the formation of these isopeptide bonds also tend to fall into these two categories. In the case of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins, tend to have a structured pathway of continuously passing along the peptide with a series of reactions, using multiple intermediate enzymes to reach the target protein for the conjugation reaction. The structural enzymes while varying from bacterial and eukaryotic domains, tend to be single enzymes that generally in a single step, fuse the two substrates together for a larger repetitive process of linking and inter-linking the said substrates to form and influence large macromolecular structures.


== Chemistry of enzymatic bonds ==


=== Biosignaling bond chemistry ===
The chemistries of isopeptide bond formation are divided in the same manner as their biological roles. In the case of isopeptides used for conjugating one protein to another for the purpose of signal transduction, the literature is generally dominated by the very well-studied Ubiquitin protein and related proteins. While there are many related proteins to Ubiquitin, such as SUMO, Atg8, Atg12, and so on, they all tend to follow relatively the same protein ligation pathway.Therefore, the best example is to look at Ubiquitin, as while there can be certain differences, Ubiquitin is essentially the model followed in all these cases. The process essentially has three tiers, in the initial step, the activating protein generally denominated as E1 activates the Ubiquitin protein by adenylating it with ATP. Then the adenylated Ubiquitin is essentially activated and can be transferred to a conserved cysteine using a thioester bond which is between the carboxyl group of the c-terminal glycine of the ubiquitin and the sulfur of the E1 cysteine. The activating E1 enzyme then binds with and transfers the Ubiquitin to the next tier, the E2 enzyme which accepts the protein and once again forms a thioester with a conserved bond. The E2 acts to certain degree as an intermediary which then binds to E3 enzyme ligase for the final tier, which leads to the eventual transfer of the ubiquitin or ubiquitin related protein to a lysine site on the targeted protein, or more commonly for ubiquitin, onto ubiquitin itself to form chains of said protein.However, in final tier, there is also a divergence, in that depending on the type of E3 ligase, it may not actually be causing the conjugation. As there are the E3 ligases containing HECT domains, in which they continue this ‘transfer chain’ by accepting once again the ubiquitin via another conserved cysteine and then targeting it and transferring it to the desired target. Yet in case of RING finger domain containing that use coordination bonds with Zinc ions to stabilize their structures, they act more to direct the reaction. By that, it's meant that once the RING finger E3 ligase binds with the E2 containing the ubiquitin, it simply acts as a targeting device which directs the E2 to directly ligate the target protein at the lysine site.Though in this case ubiquitin does represent other proteins related to it well, each protein obviously will have its own nuisances such as SUMO, which tends to be RING finger domain ligases, where the E3 simply acts as the targeting device to direct the ligation by the E2, and not actually performing the reaction itself such as the Ubiquitin E3-HECT ligases. Thus while the internal mechanisms differ such as how proteins participate in the transfer chain, the general chemical aspects such as using thioesters and specific ligases for targeting remain the same.


=== Biostructural bond chemistry ===
The enzymatic chemistry involved in the formation of isopeptides for structural purposes is different from the case of ubiquitin and ubiquitin related proteins. In that, instead of sequential steps involving multiple enzymes to activate, conjugate and target the substrate. The catalysis is performed by one enzyme and the only precursor step, if there is one, is generally cleavage to activate it from a zymogen. However, the uniformity that exists in the ubiquitin’s case is not so here, as there are numerous different enzymes all performing the reaction of forming the isopeptide bond.
The first case is that of the sortases, an enzyme family that is spread throughout numerous gram positive bacteria. It has been shown to be an important pathogenicity and virulence factor. The general reaction performed by sortases involves using its own brand of the ‘catalytic triad’: i.e. using histidine, arginine, and cysteine for the reactive mechanism. His and Arg act to help create the reactive environment, and Cys once again acts as the reaction center by using a thioester help hold a carboxyl group until the amine of a Lysine can perform a nucleophilic attack to transfer the protein and form the isopeptide bond. An ion that can sometimes play an important although indirect role in the enzymatic reaction is calcium, which is bound by sortase. It plays an important role in holding the structure of the enzyme in the optimal conformation for catalysis. However, there are cases where calcium has been shown to be non-essential for catalysis to take place.Another aspect that distinguishes sortases in general is that they have a very specific targeting for their substrate, as sortases have generally two functions, the first is the fusing of proteins to the cell wall of the bacteria and the second is the polymerization of pilin. For the process of localization of proteins to the cell wall there is three-fold requirement that the protein contain a hydrophobic domain, a positively charged tail region, and final specific sequence used for recognition. The best studied of these signals is the LPXTG, which acts as the point of cleavage, where the sortase attacks in between Thr and Gly, conjugating to the Thr carboxyl group. Then the thioester is resolved by the transfer of the peptide to a primary amine, and this generally has a very high specificity, which is seen in the example of B. cereus where the sortase D enzyme helps to polymerize the BcpA protein via two recognition signals, the LPXTG as the cleavage and thioester forming point, and the YPKN site which acts as the recognition signal as where the isopeptide will form. While the particulars may vary between bacteria, the fundamentals of sortase enzymatic chemistry remain the same.
The next case is that of Transglutaminases (TGases), which act mainly within eukaryotes for fusing together different proteins for a variety of reasons such as a wound healing or attaching proteins to lipid membranes.  The TGases themselves also contain their own ‘catalytic triad’ with Histidine, Aspartate, and Cysteine. The roles of these residues are analogous or the same as the previously described Sortases, in that His and Asp play a supporting role in interacting with the target residue, while the Cys forms a thioester with a carboxyl group for a later nucleophilic attack by a primary amine, in this case due to interest that of Lysine. Though the similarities to sortase catalytically start to end there, as the enzyme and the family is dependent on calcium, which plays a crucial structural role in holding a tight conformation of the enzyme. The TGases, also have a very different substrate specificity in that they target specifically the middle Gln, in the sequence ‘Gln-Gln-Val’. The general substrate specificity, i.e. the specific protein is due to the general structure of different TGases which targets them to the substrate.The specificity has been noted in TGases such that different TGases will react with different Gln’s on the same protein, signifying that the enzymes have a very specific initial targeting. It has also been shown to have some specificity as to which target Lysine it transfers the protein to, as in the case of Factor XIII, where the adjacent residue to the Lys decides whether the reaction will occur. Thus while the TGases may initially seem like a eukaryotic sortase, they stand on their own as separate set of enzymes.
Another case of an isopeptide linking enzyme for structural purposes is the actin cross-linking domain (ACD) of the MARTX toxin protein generated by V. cholerae. While it has been shown that the ACD when performing the catalysis uses magnesium and ATP for the formation of the cross-links the specifics of the mechanism are uncertain. Though an interesting aspect of the cross-link formed in this case, is that it uses a non-terminal Glu to ligate to a non-terminal Lys, which seems to be rare in the process of forming an isopeptide bond. Though the chemistry of ACD is still to be resolved, it shows that isopeptide bond formation is not dependent simply on Asp/Asn for non-terminal isopeptide linkages between proteins.
The final case to be looked is the curious case of the post translational modifications of microtubilin (MT). MT contains a wide array of post translational modifications; however the two of most regarded interest are polyglutamylation and polyglycylation. Both modifications are similar in the sense they are repeating stretches of the same amino acid fused to the side chain carboxyl group of glutamate at the c-terminal region of the MT. The enzymatic mechanisms are not fully fleshed out as not much is known about the polyglycating enzyme. In the case of polyglutamylation the exact mechanism is also unknown, but it does seem to be ATP-dependent. Though again there is a lack of clarity in regard to the enzymatic chemistry, there is still valuable insight in the formation of isopeptide bonds using the R-group carboxyl of Glu in conjunction with the N-terminal amino of the modifying peptides.


== Spontaneous formation ==
Researchers have exploited spontaneous isopeptide bond formation to develop a peptide tag called SpyTag. SpyTag can spontaneously and irreversibly react with its binding partner (a protein termed SpyCatcher) through a covalent isopeptide bond. This molecular tool may have applications for in vivo protein targeting, fluorescent microscopy, and  irreversible attachment for a protein microarray. Following this, other Tag/Catcher systems were developed such as SnoopTag/SnoopCatcher and SdyTag/SdyCatcher that complement SpyTag/SpyCatcher.

== Plot ==
In May 1945, remnants of the German Army continue to fight on in the Harz mountains, nicknamed ""The Void"" by American troops. An American M18 Hellcat tank destroyer, ""The Avenging Angel"", fires on a German prison and liberates the Allied prisoners held there, including Lieutenant Goss (Ben Urie). The next day the prisoners are to be transported to the rear by Sergeant Jesse Owens (K. Danor Gerald) and Private Perry (Alex Boye). Owens is not respected by some of the white soldiers because he is an African-American.
Captain Briton McConkie orders Sergeant John Atwood, commander of the Angel, and Max Whitaker, to take their respective tanks to clear the roads of any Germans to protect Owens' and Perry's convoy. The two tanks travel along the roads, with some tension arising between Private Daniel Barlow (Matt Meese) and Rodney Mitchell. Corporal Carey Simms (Adam Gregory) stops the arguments. The convoy comes across a fake body in the road, and then a hidden German Panzer III tank fires, destroying Perry's truck, killing everyone inside. The Germans open fire at Owens's truck, and he and Goss manage to escape. Further tank vs. tank encounters ensue, ending when Owens destroys a German tank with a panzerfaust. Barlow and Mitchell reconcile from their previous arguments, and Simms and Owens befriend one another over the course of the conflict.


== Cast ==


== Production ==
Ryan Little wrote the script for Saints and Soldiers: The Void a few years before it was released. He had K. Danor Gerald picked out for the role of Owens before production even started, having worked with Gerald on Forever Strong and House of Fears. Saints and Soldiers: The Void was the most expensive to film of the Saints and Soldiers franchise, because of the use of tanks. Ryan Little and Adam Abel gathered tanks from Utah, New Mexico, Colorado, and Arizona to use for filming. It was filmed in Alpine, Utah. During production, Gerald would be the last cast member to eat lunch to better understand racism for his role of an African-American soldier.


== Release and reception ==
The film was released on August 14, 2014 in a select number of theaters. The film was released on DVD in November 2014. Saints and Soldiers: The Void received mixed reviews. The Salt Lake Tribune called the film a, ""riveting action drama with a strong message."" However, Deseret News wrote that the film, ""offers an important message and some nice visuals. But there's still the feeling that a little more focus on writing and execution would have etched a more enduring experience.""

=== Club ===
Bobadilla started his career at Paraguayan club Cerro Porteño already in the junior league, he was trained by Modesto Sandoval that is how he got the skills to play in the pro team some years later, then moved to Gimnasia y Esgrima de La Plata of Argentina. He returned to Paraguay to play for Club Libertad until mid-2006, when he signed for Argentine Boca Juniors.
Though he started the last season as the first-choice goalkeeper for Boca Juniors, he lost his place to Caranta after his rival's good performances in friendly matches.
In early September 2007 he signed a contract with Colombian side Independiente Medellín helping the team overcome the problem they had in the previous season by being the team with the most goals scored against.

","The scarlet-chested sunbird (Chalcomitra senegalensis) is a species of bird in the family Nectariniidae.

== Taxonomy ==
In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the scarlet-chested sunbird in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected in Senegal. He used the French name Le grimpereau violet du Sénégal and the Latin Certhia Senegalensis Violacea. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the scarlet-chested sunbird. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Certhia senegalensis and cited Brisson's work. This species is now placed in the genus Chalcomitra that was introduced by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach in 1853. Six subspecies are recognised.

== Plot ==
John Harrington is a handsome, 30-year-old man who feels compelled to murder young brides to remember details of a childhood trauma. John lives in a spacious villa outside Paris, where he manages a bridal dress factory belonging to his deceased mother and financially supported by his wife Mildred. He and Mildred are ill-matched, but she refuses to consider his appeals for a divorce. Whenever he hears that one of the models working at the dress factory is to be married, he hacks her to death with a meat cleaver while she is wearing her bridal gown, burns the body in the furnace of his greenhouse, and uses the ashes as fertilizer. Each murder gives him a slightly clearer image of his traumatic memory. Inspector Russell frequently drops by to question John about the six models who have disappeared from his bridal salon, but with a lack of hard evidence, cannot arrest him.
At his office, John meets Helen Wood, who has come to apply for the job ""vacated"" by one of the mysteriously disappeared models. Impressed by her wit and beauty, John hires her. Over the next few days, John falls in love with Helen. After dropping Mildred off at the airport for a weeklong vacation, he takes Helen out to dinner. He returns to find Mildred at home; she reveals that the vacation was a ruse, and she took the next flight back in hopes of catching him in the act of infidelity. Feeling entrapped by Mildred's constant presence, he dons a wedding gown and hacks her to death with the cleaver. He buries her in the grounds of the greenhouse.
Everyone John speaks to sees Mildred, very much alive, but John cannot see or hear her. He burns Mildred's remains in the furnace and keeps the ashes in a handbag, but she continues to haunt him until he scatters the ashes over a river and discards the handbag. When John attempts to murder another woman, he is foiled by Inspector Russell. His urges thus frustrated, when he returns home to find Helen waiting for him, he cannot repress the desire to murder her as a substitute. He takes Helen to the same concealed room where he murdered most of the models. After convincing her to change into a wedding dress, he tells Helen that he never wanted to hurt her, but wants to ""fit this last piece into place."" He strikes at Helen with the cleaver. She blocks the blow, but the initial surge finally restores John's memory: as a young boy, upset by his mother's remarrying, he killed her and his stepfather with a cleaver.
Helen lets Inspector Russell and a team of policemen into the room; Russell had convinced her to take part in this sting operation before John had hired her. John is loaded into a police van with two policemen escorting him. One of them sets the handbag with Mildred's ashes down beside John. Mildred appears, this time to John only. She tells him that now they will be together forever, ""first in the insane asylum, and then in Hell for all eternity"". John goes berserk with terror.

== Production ==
Hatchet for the Honeymoon was initiated by Spanish producer Manuel Caño, who interested director Mario Bava in Santiago Moncada's script. During preproduction, Laura Betti (who had recently won the prestigious Volpi Cup for Best Actress at the 29th Venice International Film Festival for Teorema) telephoned Bava and asked for a role in his next film. Betti explained: In Italy, I was always considered an intellectual actress. Bava, in my opinion, was a fantastic director, but he was also the opposite, let us say, of an intellectual filmmaker. After my victory - after that consecration - I called Bava and said, ""Here it is, my Oscar, my prize, and now I want to shoot something with you!"" And he immediately got my joke, do you see? He knew that he wasn't an intellectual, but he had the same ironical point of view, as I do, about intellectuals. So that was the beginning of our friendship. [emphasis in original]

Bava wanted to work with Betti immediately, but Moncada's script had no role remotely suitable for her, so he came up with the subplot involving Mildred Harrington in order to cast her. Having been promised she would be the female lead, and having met the producers' requirement that she lose 25 pounds before filming, Dagmar Lassander was incensed when she saw that the revised script sidelined her character in favor of Betti. This, along with the fact that she was Caño's lover at the time and a language barrier due to her only speaking German and some English, led to her having antagonistic relations with Bava and Betti on set; she later successfully sued Caño for failing in his promise to make her the film's top-billed actress. At least one scene, in which John introduces Helen to Inspector Russell, was added solely to appease Lassander by giving her more screen time.Lead actor Stephen Forsyth recalled that Bava did not give him detailed direction on set. When he approached Bava privately, he revealed that Bava ""smiled and he said, 'Listen, if you were doing anything wrong, if there was anything I had to tell you, I would tell you.'""Hatchet for the Honeymoon had the least money allotted for special effects of any film directed by Bava, so nearly all of the visual effects were achieved in-camera, usually by rapidly adjusting the focus, or shooting through distorted lenses.Principal photography took place from September to October 1968 primarily in Barcelona, under the working title Un'accetta per la luna di miele (literally ""A hatchet for the honeymoon""). The villa of Francisco Franco served as the Harrington household. The cast and director both described the villa's atmosphere as oppressive, with armed guards constantly present to ensure they did not shoot on the upstairs floors or damage the furnishings. The discothèque scenes were filmed at Balcazar Studios, also in Barcelona, before the crew moved on to the Villa Frascatti in Rome in order to shoot the scenes at the Harrington household which the restrictions at the Franco villa would not allow them to capture. These include all the scenes in the bathroom, bedroom, and mannequin-filled room.Caño decided to set the story in Paris, so a second unit led by Bava's assistant director and son Lamberto was sent there to capture some exterior scenes. By this time, the film's budget had run out, and Forsyth had been working without pay for two weeks. He accompanied the crew to Paris, but refused to take part in the shoot until he was paid. As such, he was replaced by a body double for the Paris exteriors, which were shot at a distance to hide his physical differences from Forsyth; virtually none of the Paris sequences were used in the completed film.With the budget spent, filming was halted and Bava accepted an invitation from Dick Randall to direct Four Times That Night. As that film neared completion, he showed the Hatchet for the Honeymoon script to Four Times That Night's executive producer, Alfredo Leone, in the hope that he would rescue the film, but he was unimpressed with the script. However, in the interim Caño secured the funds needed to finally complete the film. Filming for Hatchet for the Honeymoon ended in October 1969.


== Release ==
Hatchet for the Honeymoon was released in Italy as Il rosso segno della follia on 2 June 1970 and in Spain as Un hacha para la luna del miel on 14 September 1970, with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer handling its distribution in these regions. The film was released in the United Kingdom under the title Blood Brides by Tigon British Film Productions in 1973. In the United States, the film was released through GG Productions on 9 February 1974. In all of these countries, excepting Spain, it received a limited release with little marketing support.


== Critical reaction ==
In a contemporary review, Robin Wood reviewed a dubbed 88 minute version of the film titled Blood Brides. Wood noted that the film contained several examples of what Wood described as ""Bava's claim to attention [...] he usually photographs as well as directs his films, they are very consciously conceived in terms of potentialities of the camera and as a result are, in a somewhat crude sense, 'cinematic'."" Wood went on to state that ""the creation of elaborate effects through camera movement, stylized color, focus distortion and the use of varied lenses is, however, no guarantee of quality; and the effects in Blood Brides appear merely self-conscious and self-indulgent.""In a retrospective review, AllMovie called it ""not the best of Mario Bava's work"", but ""a must see for those who love the genre and admire stylish horror films."" Tim Lucas, author of the critical biography Mario Bava: All the Colors of the Dark, calls Hatchet For the Honeymoon ""Mario Bava's most personal horror movie"" and states ""Time has shown the film, initially misunderstood and considered one of Bava's lesser works, to be startlingly prescient, pointing the way for Mary Harron's film of Bret Easton Ellis' American Psycho in particular."" The film holds a 50% ""rotten"" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on six reviews.

== History ==
Doni Zasloff grew up in Washington, DC and Philadelphia, and earned a degree in musical theater from Brandeis University. She began writing her own songs while teaching at her daughter's synagogue preschool, eventually forming the Mama Doni Band, which won the Simcha Award at the 2008 International Jewish Music Festival.Eric Lindberg grew up in Brooklyn but often visited his father's family in Georgia, where he developed an appreciation for bluegrass music. He began playing guitar at the age of 10, inspired by blues musicians like Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix. He also cites Pat Metheny and Bela Fleck as influences on his work. He has a degree in jazz performance from Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University.The two began writing music together in 2010, originally for Zasloff's career as ""Mama Doni"", but found that the mashup of Jewish liturgy and bluegrass melodies worked. At the same time, the two became a couple and eventually married. They characterize their music as a continuation of the cultural exchange between Jews and the countries they live in that produced musical genres such as klezmer.They started out performing their music at Shabbat services, and then at shows. By 2014, they settled on the name ""Nefesh Mountain"" (nefesh is the Hebrew word for soul) and went on tour with bass player Tim Kiah and violinist Alan Grubner.
They recorded the album Beneath The Open Sky in Nashville, Tennessee, recording with veteran bluegrass musicians Sam Bush, Jerry Douglas, Tony Trischka, and David Grier. The song ""Narrow Bridge"" (based on a saying by Rabbi Nachman of Breslov) was inspired by the political climate after the 2016 presidential election. The music video was filmed in winter on a frozen lake at Woodstock in the Catskills.

== History ==
It is named after Khlong Bang Phrom, a khlong (canal) that currents through the northern area and a dividing line between its area with neighbouring Bang Ramat.
In the past, Bang Phrom used to be a rice planting area and there was a wide area extending to neighbouring subdistricts such as Bang Ramat. Local farmers therefore respect Phosop (goddess of rice) and there was a shrine dedicated to her which still exists today inside Wat Siri Watthanaram where confluence of three khlongs Bang Phrom, Lat Ta Niao, and Latmayom. Also in those day, they will have a ceremony to invite the Phosop statue procession to the various khlongs in Taling Chan at around 09.00 am. Then brought up to be enshrined in a local temple and have a complete celebration all night. Later the next day, therefore back by passing Khlong Bang Chueak Nang.
Her original statue is rumored to be gold. It has been stolen by three men from outside the area circa the late 1970s until today, this original statue is not found.
Most mill owners in this area are Chinese.
What is a pity that at present Bang Phrom do not have rice fields anymore. In which the last rice fields were dissolved around 1983.
In the year 1940, Bang Phrom consists of 20 mubans (village).It contained 15 administrative villages until the dissolution of administrative villages in the area of Bangkok.


== Geography ==
Bang Phrom can be considered as the southeast part of the district, with a total area of 4.253 km2 (1.642 mi2).
Neighbouring subdistricts are (from the north clockwise): Bang Ramat and Khlong Chak Phra in its district, Khuha Sawan of Phasi Charoen district, Bang Chueak Nang in its district, and Thawi Watthana of Thawi Watthana district, respectively.Like other areas of Taling Chan, Bang Phrom is filled with many ancient temples and agricultural areas. In which there are a total of 1,182 rai (467.1 acres) of agricultural land.Bang Phrom  is an area that is easily accessible from Soi Charan Sanit Wong 35 in Bang Khun Si subdistrict, Bangkok Noi district and also consists of many roads.The eponymous Khlong Bang Phrom is a main watercourse of the area.

The railway begins in Palenque in Chiapas and travels northeast towards Cancún in Quintana Roo via two routes that encircle the peninsula. The project aims to connect tourist destinations in the Yucatán, including historic Mayan sites from which it derives its name.


== History ==
The Mayan Train project was announced in September 2018 by Mexican president-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador, following earlier proposals to build a shorter 900-kilometre (560 mi) line. Previous presidential administrations had also proposed their own high-speed rail projects, but were unsuccessful in attaining funding. It would use existing right of way from Ferrosur as well as new tracks constructed through the jungle. The Zapatista Army of National Liberation announced that it would oppose the project. The project was also derided as a political stunt for López Obrador, who had also cancelled a major airport project in Mexico City favored by his predecessor. A public referendum on approving the project in November 2018 was passed by 89 percent of voters with a turnout of approximately one percent.


=== December 2019 consultation ===
On November 15, 2019, President López Obrador declared that a referendum on the Mayan Train would be held on December 15, 2019 in Chiapas, Tabasco, Campeche, Yucatán, and Quintana Roo.The weekend of December 15–16, 2019, 92.3% of the people who participated in the consultation voted in favor, while 7.4% voted against the proposal. 100,940 people voted, 2.36% of the 3,536,000 registered voters in the 84 municipalities affected.The United Nations Human Rights Council sharply criticized the vote. They pointed out that voters were provided with only the positive effects of the project (improved attention to water supplies, health, education, employment, housing, environmental protection, and culture) but were not informed of the negative effects. The Human Rights Commission also criticized the translations of the material used, the short period of time for the election, and low turnout, particularly among indigenous women. They noted that many potential voters did not have the financial resources to travel to the voting locations, and that the majority of voters were municipal employees. For its part, the government rejected the criticisms, saying that the consultation met international standards and attacked ""la descalificación ni la crítica simple, sin sustento, ligera y parcializada"". (""the light and biased disqualification or simple criticism, without support"").


== Funding ==
Funding for the project will come primarily from a tourism tax levied in the region, as well as funds diverted from other programs, including the Mexican Grand Prix.The project, led by the National Fund for Tourism Development (Fonatur), in December 2018 was estimated to cost 150 billion pesos (US$7.4 billion) and attract 8,000 daily riders. An alternative study by a public policy think tank in 2019 estimated the cost of the project would be 480 billion pesos (US$25.3 billion), supported by the 90 percent cost overrun on the Toluca–Mexico City railway project. In October 2021 Fonatur revised the construction estimate to 200 billion pesos.In October 2020 the estimated total cost of the project, including 30 years of operating and maintenance but not including electrification, was about 321 billion pesos.The Secretariat of Tourism will receive a 647.1% increase in its budget for 2021 (MXN $38,613.4 million), of which 94% is destined for the Mayan Train.In December 2020 president López Obrador announced that the armed forces would operate three sections of the route, and that profits would be used to strengthen finances for pensioners and retirees of the armed forces. In March 2021 Fonatur general director Rogelio Jiménez Pons said that the military would own the entire route, not just the three sections, and would receive all of the profits.Rogelio Jimenez Pons, director of Fonatur, stated in September 2021 that the cost of a single trip for locals, for the section that goes from Cancún to Playa del Carmen will be around 50 pesos. Tourists will be expected to pay between 800 to 1000 pesos for the same trip.  When explaining the difference in price, he stated that the tourist will have additional services such as restaurants.


== Construction ==
On December 16, 2018, president López Obrador conducted a Mayan ritual to commemorate the start of construction on the Mayan Train project. The railway will also accommodate local passenger traffic and freight shipments in addition to tourist functions. The first phase of the project is anticipated to open in the late 2020s, but tourism officials in the region have proposed accelerating work for a 2023 opening.The route consists of seven sections. Section I runs from Palenque to Escárcega (228 km); section II from Escárcega to Calkiní (235 km); section III from Calkiní to Izamal (172 km); section IV from Izamal to Cancún (257 km); section V from Cancún to Tulum (121 km); section VI from Tulum to Bacalar (254 km); and section VII from Bacalar to Escárcega (287 km).Business leaders in Mérida, Yucatán, expressed their support on January 31, 2020, for building four kilometers of the railway underground as it passes through the city of Merida. In this way, the train will not threaten the city's historic center. They are also optimistic that the tourist train, in combination with improvements in energy, airports, and seaports, will make the region economically competitive with the North and the Bajío. Fonatur later announced that the train would initially not stop in Mérida, but near a hacienda 8 km away. They said that by 2025 the station will relocate to La Plancha Park in Mérida.Construction began in June 2020. The construction companies are Mota-Engil México SAPI and China Communications Construction Company LTD for stretch one (Plenque-Escárcega), Operadora CICSA and FCC Construcción for stretch two (Escárcega-Calkiní), Construcciones Urales and GAMI Ingeniería e Instalaciones for stretch three (Calkiní-Izmal), and Grupo ICA for stretch four (Izmal–Cancún). In September 2020 Fonatur rejected the proposal of investment firm BlackRock for the fifth stretch (125 km) of the project, including improvements to the Tulum–Cancún highway.In February 2021 Fonatur awarded a contract to Acciona and Grupo México for 60.3 km of electrified double rail tracks for section five between Playa del Carmen and Tulum.As of January 2021, plans call for diesel-electric trains running at up to 160 km/h. In May 2021 Fonatur contracted with a consortium headed by Alstom to supply rolling stock and related equipment. The rolling stock will be manufactured at Alstom's factory in Ciudad Sahagún. The contract also includes European Train Control System signalling and control equipment.The Mexican president wants the entire project completed prior to the end of his term in 2024. Most rail construction firms consider this too fast, an unreasonable time to construct so much new rail, and fear a disaster from poor quality work such as the May 2021 fatal collapse on Line 12 in the Mexico City Metro. In January 2022, to speed up construction, the route was changed to no longer enter Playa del Carmen.As of June 2021, 10% of the project had been completed. This had increased to 15% by March 2022.


== Opposition ==
Environmental and indigenous rights activists objected to construction of new tracks through the jungle.On the 26th anniversary of its armed uprising, January 1, 2020, the Zapatista Army of National Liberation expressed its opposition to the project and declared that the consultation provided only positive information to voters prior to voting.Groups close to the National Indigenous Congress (CNI) plan to seek injunctions against the train project and other megaprojects in the region. The CNI is looking at three-pronged action: social awareness campaigns, media campaigns, and legal actions. On January 28, 2020, a judge in Campeche issued a temporary injunction against construction of the railway because was approved in a ""simulated consultation."" In a visit to the city of Campeche, President López Obrador defended the train and pointed out that not only had the train received its greatest support in the state of Campeche, but also that more than half the route would run through the state—worth MXN $60 billion of the $130 billion the government plans to invest in total. He said the section from Escárcega to Cancún should be open for tourist, passenger, and freight traffic in 2023, but that the route will not pass through the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve.In November 2020 the Regional Indigenous Council of Xpujil delivered a petition with 268,000 signatures to the Campeche Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources asking that the project be suspended because of environmental concerns. Residents of Chocholá, Mérida, and Izamal, in Yucatán obtained a temporary delay in construction in January 2021 until Fonatur and SEMARNAT report on an environmental impact assessment.On March 3, 2021, an injunction was filed by 80 people from Campeche who fear eviction from their homes. The First District Court in Campeche granted them the provisional suspension. Yucatán’s fourth district court also ordered a stop to construction. The brought the total number of injunctions filed in the Yucatan Peninsula to 16 in March 2021, increasing to at least 25 by January 2022. Most of the injunctions have been filed by indigenous collectives who consider the project to be an environmental disaster. The injunctions have had little effect, and construction continues.

As of January 2021 crews had uncovered more than 8000 ancient artifacts and structures during construction.The National Alliance for Conservation of the Jaguar has identified twelve wildlife corridors that could be constructed to mitigate the situation for the jaguars that live in the area.The Centro Mexicano de Derecho Ambiental environmental group has accused Fonatur of deforestation along the route, not accounted for in the Environmental Impact Assessment and without acquiring the necessary permits. In November 2021 the Interior Department exempted Tren Maya and other infrastructure projects from environmental review.Original plans called for electric locomotives on the trains. In June 2020 the government announced a switch to diesel to keep costs down, then in August 2020 they announced that half the route, from Mérida to Chetumal via Cancún, would be electrified.

== Evolution of environmental flow concepts and recognition ==
From the turn of the 20th century through the 1960s, water management in developed nations focused largely on maximizing flood protection, water supplies, and hydropower generation. During the 1970s, the ecological and economic effects of these projects prompted scientists to seek ways to modify dam operations to maintain certain fish species. The initial focus was on determining the minimum flow necessary to preserve an individual species, such as trout, in a river. Environmental flows evolved from this concept of ""minimum flows"" and, later, ""instream flows"", which emphasized the need to keep water within waterways.
By the 1990s, scientists came to realize that the biological and social systems supported by rivers are too complicated to be summarized by a single minimum flow requirement. Since the 1990s, restoring and maintaining more comprehensive environmental flows has gained increasing support, as has the capability of scientists and engineers to define these flows to maintain the full spectrum of riverine species, processes and services. Furthermore, implementation has evolved from dam reoperation to an integration of all aspects of water management, including groundwater and surface water diversions and return flows, as well as land use and storm water management. The science to support regional-scale environmental flow determination and management has likewise advanced.In a global survey of water specialists undertaken in 2003 to gauge perceptions of environmental flow, 88% of the 272 respondents agreed that the concept is essential for sustainably managing water resources and meeting the long-term needs of people. In 2007, the Brisbane Declaration on Environmental Flows was endorsed by more than 750 practitioners from more than 50 countries. The declaration announced an official pledge to work together to protect and restore the world's rivers and lakes. By 2010, many countries throughout the world had adopted environmental flow policies, although their implementation remains a challenge.


== Examples ==

One effort currently underway to restore environmental flows is the Sustainable Rivers Project, a collaboration between The Nature Conservancy (TNC) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), which is the largest water manager in the United States. Since 2002, TNC and the USACE have been working to define and implement environmental flows by altering the operations of USACE dams in 8 rivers across 12 states. Dam reoperation to release environmental flows, in combination with floodplain restoration, has in some instances increased the water available for hydropower production while reducing flood risk.
Arizona's Bill Williams River, flowing downstream of Alamo Dam, is one of the rivers featured in the Sustainable Rivers Project. Having discussed modifying dam operations since the early 1990s, local stakeholders began to work with TNC and USACE in 2005 to identify specific strategies for improving the ecological health and biodiversity of the river basin downstream from the dam. Scientists compiled the best available information and worked together to define environmental flows for the Bill Williams River.  While not all of the recommended environmental flow components could be implemented immediately, the USACE has changed its operations of Alamo Dam to incorporate more natural low flows and controlled floods. Ongoing monitoring is capturing resulting ecological responses such as rejuvenation of native willow-cottonwood forest, suppression of invasive and non-native tamarisk, restoration of more natural densities of beaver dams and associated lotic-lentic habitat, changes in aquatic insect populations, and enhanced groundwater recharge. USACE engineers continue to consult with scientists on a regular basis and use the monitoring results to further refine operations of the dam.Another case in which stakeholders developed environmental flow recommendations is Honduras' Patuca III Hydropower Project. The Patuca River, the second longest river in Central America, has supported fish populations, nourished crops, and enabled navigation for many indigenous communities, including the Tawahka, Pech, and Miskito Indians, for hundreds of years. To protect the ecological health of the largest undisturbed rainforest north of the Amazon and its inhabitants, TNC and Empresa Nacional de Energía Eléctrica (ENEE, the agency responsible for the project) agreed to study and determine flows necessary to sustain the health of human and natural communities along the river. Due to very limited available data, innovative approaches were developed for estimating flow needs based on experiences and observations of the local people who depend on this nearly pristine river reach.


== Methods, tools, and models ==
More than 200 methods are used worldwide to prescribe river flows needed to maintain healthy rivers. However, very few of these are comprehensive and holistic, accounting for seasonal and inter-annual flow variation needed to support the whole range of ecosystem services that healthy rivers provide. Such comprehensive approaches include DRIFT (Downstream Response to Imposed Flow Transformation), BBM (Building Block Methodology), and the ""Savannah Process"" for site-specific environmental flow assessment, and ELOHA (Ecological Limits of Hydrologic Alteration) for regional-scale water resource planning and management.  The ""best"" method, or more likely, methods, for a given situation depends on the amount of resources and data available, the most important issues, and the level of certainty required. To facilitate environmental flow prescriptions, a number of computer models and tools have been developed by groups such as the USACE's Hydrologic Engineering Center Archived 2013-03-08 at the Wayback Machine to capture flow requirements defined in a workshop setting (e.g., HEC-RPT) or to evaluate the implications of environmental flow implementation (e.g., HEC-ResSim, HEC-RAS, and HEC-EFM).
Additionally, a 2D model is developed from a 3D turbulence model based on Smagorinsky large eddy closure to more appropriately model environmental large scale flows. This model is based on a slow manifold of the turbulent Smagorinsky large eddy closure instead of conventional depth-averaging flow equations.
Other tried and tested environmental flow assessment methods include DRIFT (King et al. 2003), which was recently used in the Kishenganga HPP dispute between Pakistan and India at the International Court of Arbitration.


== In India ==
In India, the need for environmental flows has emerged from the hundreds of large dams being planned in the Himalayan rivers for hydro power generation. The cascades of dams planned across the Lohit, Dibang River in the Brahmaputra River , the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi River in the Ganga basin and the Teesta in Sikkim for example, would end up in the rivers flowing more through tunnels and pen stocks rather than the river channels. There have been some recommendations by various authorities (Courts, Tribunals, Expert Appraisal Committee of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)) on releasing e-flows from dams. However, these recommendations have never been backed by strong objectives about why certain e-flow releases are needed.

Between 1877 and 1975 the beacon was supplemented by a series of lightships. The beacon still stands to this day, but the reef is now guarded by the Fife Ness lighthouse on the mainland.


== Description ==
The reef extends for 1.5 miles (2.4 km) northeastwards from Fife Ness Points Coastguard station (East Coast Fife) into the North Sea and the greater Firth of Forth. It is made up of some fourteen sandstone rocks that are completely submerged at high tide. These include Englishman's Skelly, Kneestone, Tullybothy Craigs, Lochaber Rock and Mary's Skelly.
Carr is a Scots term for a coastal rock, found as an element in the names of reefs and small islands in south-east Scotland and north-east England. It may have entered Old English from a Celtic source; compare carra or carraig in Gaelic, terms for a ledge or projecting rock.


== History ==
Shipwrecks around the reef include the schooner Louise; the trawlers James Ross & Festing Grindall; the tanker Vildfugl; the brig Andreas; the paddle steamer Commodore; the coaster Island Magee; the cargo steamer Einar Jarl & Bjornhaug.
A buoy was first placed by the Northern Lighthouse Board in 1809, but this was found to be inadequate and would wreck in winter storms. The remains can still be seen of a second project, the North Carr Beacon. This was started in 1813 by Robert Stevenson, a famous lighthouse engineer. Stevenson had just finished the Bell Rock Lighthouse and was about to start a new lighthouse on the Isle of May, 8 miles to the south of North Carr. Since North Carr was barely uncovered even at low tide, work could proceed on only two or three tides each fortnight, so the plan was to work on it when conditions allowed and switch the men to the Isle of May at other times.

Stevenson planned a 40 feet (12 m) hollow tower topped by a bell. The bell would be rung by an ingenious mechanism powered by the tide. The foundations of North Carr were confined to just 18 feet (5.5 m) of fractured sandstone, a limited ""toehold"" compared even to Bell Rock (42 feet (13 m)) and whilst it was under construction parts of the structure were swept away in storms in 1815, 1816 and 1817. In 1817 the tower had been nearly complete when it was reduced to the fifth course of stones, so the design was changed to a pyramidal structure of cast iron columns with a ball on top. This was completed in 1821; £5,000 had been spent in total.

A lightship on loan from Trinity House joined the beacon on 7 June 1887, located one mile off North Carr. The 8 feet (240 cm) fixed light could be seen for 11 miles (18 km). Two years later it was replaced by a ship purpose-built for the Northern Lighthouse Board by Alexander Stephen and Sons of Dundee. This was sold in 1933 and replaced by a vessel built by A. & J. Inglis of Glasgow. This had a 1000W electric light, fixed at first and later flashing twice every half minute. It was moved to the mouth of the Clyde during World War II. The lightship broke adrift from her moorings in a gale on 8 December 1959 and all eight crew members of the Broughty Ferry lifeboat died trying to rescue her. The crew of the lightship managed to set anchor off Kingsbarns and were taken off by helicopter the next day but the ship was not taken under tow until 11 December. The lightship was replaced by a lighted buoy in 1975, at the same time as a lighthouse was built at Fife Ness on the mainland. The lightship was saved from the scrapyard in 2010 and funds are being sought by the Taymara charity to restore her as an exhibition space on the Dundee waterfront.


== Visiting ==

Visitors can park in the Crail Golfing Society carpark and follow the track that leads to the lighthouse and Coastguard Station. The North Carr rocks are only visible at low tide. When Stevenson was building the beacon, the stone blocks were cut and checked for fitting on the foreshore here prior to being shipped out to the reef. The bedrock was levelled to form a base for the first course of blocks and a higher course. These circular outlines can still be seen cut into the rock on the shore, as can the nearby remains of the quay where the finished blocks were loaded onto the workboat. 
Pods of dolphin and less frequently whales can be seen from the shore, with the aid of binoculars.

=== Early career and Halmstads BK ===
Born in Trönninge, Gudmundsson started his youth career at hometown club Trönninge IF before joining the youth rankings of Halmstads BK in 1986. His first senior appearance came in the last round of the 1988 Swedish football Division 1 against IK Oddevold, also securing promotion to the Allsvenskan. He became a first team regular in 1990 and won the 1994–95 Svenska Cupen. Gudmundsson also had a trial at Norwich City, but was not signed.During the 1995–96 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, Gudmundsson scored twice in a 3–0 against Parma, only to see a 4–0 defeat in the away leg that knocked Halmstad out of the competition.


=== Blackburn Rovers ===
After finishing in the third place at the 1995 Allsvenskan, Gudmundsson moved to Premier League side Blackburn Rovers first on a loan until March 1996, when he was purchased for £1 million.He made his debut for the 1994–95 FA Premier League champions in a 3–0 win against Sheffield Wednesday on 20 January 1996. He made a total of four appearances for the Rovers while on loan before getting injured and also had two appearances in the 1996–97 season, all of them coming from the bench.


==== Loan to Ipswich ====
In March 1997, Gudmundsson was loaned to Ipswich Town, scoring three goals in ten Football League First Division games. Although he impressed at the club, they were unable to afford his transfer fee and he returned to Blackburn Rovers.


=== Malmö FF ===
After returning to Blackburn, Gudmundsson was out of the plans of the new coach Roy Hodgson and was transferred to Malmö FF with the English club receiving Anders Andersson in the deal. He played at Malmö FF until the end of 2000 and was targeted by Norwegian club Bryne FK after being relegated in the 1999 Allsvenskan, but no deal was completed.


=== IF Elfsborg, Ängelholms FF, and retirement ===
In 2001, Gudmundsson moved to IF Elfsborg, winning the 2000–01 Svenska Cupen. He played only three league matches in 2002 due to a knee injury. In 2003, he signed for Ängelholms FF, playing for the club until 2007.

It was built c. 1855. It is also known as Gayndah Race Track. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 12 September 2005.


== History ==
The Gayndah Racecourse was established in the mid 1850s to replace a track established nearby in 1852. The first Queensland Derby race was held there in 1868 and the course is still in regular use for horse racing.Europeans in search of grazing land for sheep first explored the Burnett in the early 1840s and the town of Gayndah was founded in 1849 to serve pastoral stations in the district. The site of the town was chosen and named by Maurice O'Connell, then Land Commissioner for the area. Gayndah developed as an administrative centre, having a court house and police station in the 1850s, soon followed a school, post office and bank. It was at one time considered to be a contender for the capital of Queensland when Separation from New South Wales was contemplated. By the late 19th century, cattle had replaced sheep on the surrounding pastoral properties and citrus orchards had been successfully established. From the turn of the century, dairying also played a part in the providing an economic basis for the development of the area.In 1852, the year that Gayndah was officially gazetted as a town, a public meeting was held at the Burnett Arms in Gayndah to organise the setting up of a track for horse racing. £100 was collected and a suitable area at the edge of town selected. The winning post was set up midway between two hotels, the Burnett Arms and the Corinth Arms, which were about two and a half miles apart. The first race was held on 30 June 1852. It was a three-day event with racing on the first and third days for prizes in excess of £100. This track was used for a few years before the current and more level site nearby replaced it, probably in 1855 or 1856.A meeting was held at the Royal Hotel, Gayndah in July 1858 to mount a petition to Sir William Denison, Governor of New South Wales (the separation of Queensland did not occur until 1859), to grant the Crown Land on which the track was situated for use as a racecourse on the grounds that the town had not been granted a recreation reserve and there was no other course closer than Ipswich, 230 miles (370 km) away. There were 65 signatories to the petition, but it did not have an easy passage.As the land on which the track was located was in an area intended to serve as future suburban allotments, the government was at first inclined to refuse the request and on 6 May 1859 asked for guidance from the Surveyor General's office. A report of 25 August 1859 recommended that as town development was in fact taking place away from this area, a reserve of between 100 and 120 acres (40 and 49 ha) should be granted for a racecourse. The request was approved on 11 June 1859, but Queensland was separated from New South Wales on 10 December 1859 as a self-governing colony. The racecourse reserve, of 180 acres (73 ha), was surveyed in March 1862 and the land grant signed by Sir George Bowen, the first Governor of Queensland, on 26 March 1863 at a quit rent of one farthing ""as a racecourse and for no other purpose"". Trustees were Berkely Basil Moreton, Alpin Grant Cameron, Robert Wilkin Smith, Gilbert William Eliott and Francis Glynn Connolly.Horses had arrived in Australia with the First Fleet in 1788 and the first organised horse race was run at Hyde Park in 1810. In 1842 the first racing club, the Australian Jockey Club, was formed. In Queensland, horse racing was one of the earliest organised sports following the opening of the Moreton Bay District for free settlement. The first race meeting was held at Coopers Plains on 17 July 1843 and there was a racecourse at New Farm in Brisbane by May 1846. In 1848 the towns of Warwick, Ipswich and Drayton organised race meetings. Government authorities took racing seriously as more than a sport as horses were then the main means of transport for economic, military and recreational purposes and racing was thought to help improve breeding.In 1861, the Gayndah Race Club decided to change its name to the Queensland Jockey Club; at the time, racing at Brisbane was under the auspices of the Brisbane Race Club and at Ipswich as the North Australia Race Club. Eagle Farm Racecourse opened in Brisbane in 1863, replacing the 1846 New Farm track, and the Queensland Turf Club was formed. The Gayndah racecourse by this time had booths for hire where publicans and confectioners supplied refreshments.Gayndah hosted the first Queensland Derby held in Queensland. This is a classic race for three-year-olds run over one and a half miles and was first held in 1780 at Epsom in England, being named for the 12th Earl of Derby. In Australia the first Derby was run in 1861 at Randwick in Sydney and in 1868 one was held at Gayndah. Bookmakers came up from Melbourne for the event. The race was won by the house Hermit, with owner William Parry-Okeden receiving the prize of 20 sovereigns. The Derby was held at Gayndah for two more years until falling into abeyance and being revived in 1872 in Brisbane.The race meetings were gala events attended by people from the surrounding district and from as far afield as Port Curtis, Ipswich and Nanango. Horses came from as far away as Sydney to compete and Gayndah considered itself the racing centre of Queensland, even after the Derby had moved to Brisbane. A Brisbane Cup was held in 1866 and a Gayndah Cup in 1867 quickly followed by Cup events at Gympie, Maryborough, Rockhampton, Townsville, Charters Towers, Toowoomba, Warwick and Dalby.In spite of the early establishment of the Queensland Turf Club and the development of horse racing in regional centres during the 1860s and 1870s, it did not become popular in Queensland on a large scale until the 1880s, when there was a boom in racing and many new clubs were formed and race meetings held. A new code of rules was adopted in 1885 based on those of the English Jockey Club and a system of registration of all clubs under the Queensland Turf Club rules was instituted. The Queensland Racing Calendar was first published in 1886 and in 1890 all clubs agreed to empower the Queensland Turf Club to allot dates for meetings to prevent clashes.In 1914 the racecourse land was gazetted as a reserve under Trustees led by the Mayor of Gayndah and on 29 October 1937 a special meeting was held by the Council to formulate by-laws. These were gazetted on 3 March 1938 under the provisions of the Local Government Land Act 1936. The Gayndah Shire Council are still trustees for the racecourse.New service buildings were constructed at the racecourse in the 1980s. The track itself has been in use as a racecourse since its inception and the Gayndah Jockey Club still hosts regular racing meetings there.A statue of a horse and rider in Capper Street commemorates the running of the first Queensland Derby.


== Description ==
The Gayndah Racecourse occupies a large level area on the southeast side of the town. It is bounded on three sides by roads and a large block of open land adjoins it to the south.Two gates access the racecourse grounds. One comprises timber posts supporting a tubular metal structure framing the letters G.J.C. for Gayndah Jockey Club, the other is a timber gate constructed to commemorate the Centenary of Federation and also the founding in Gayndah of Queensland's first Jockey Club in 1861 and the first Queensland Derby in 1868.The track itself occupies most of the space and is enclosed on either side by a fence of metal posts with a white painted top rail. It is grassed and roughly oval in shape, being 17,097 metres (56,093 ft) in circumference with a training track on the inside. Crops are currently grown in the centre of the course.A mechanical starting stall is used to start each race and the straight with the winning post is set at the northwest corner of the track overlooked by a metal tower. Bougainvilleas are planted along the edge of the track in this area and to the north of the tower is a set of parallel rails coloured red, yellow and blue for the winning horses. To the rear of the paddock area and extending southwest are two parallel sets of modern buildings. The facilities closest to the track include a clubhouse and betting ring, bars, a ladies' room and a tearoom and kitchen. A second set of buildings to the northwest comprises jockeys' rooms, offices and the Totalisator office with a toilet block at the northern end. There are also 60 day stalls for horses and a swabbing stall with a washing down bay at the end of the stalls. The saddling enclosure is between the jockeys' room and the track.All these buildings currently serving the course were constructed towards the end of the 20th century and have no heritage significance.


== Heritage listing ==
Gayndah Racecourse was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 12 September 2005 having satisfied the following criteria.The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.
As a horseracing track, established in the 1850s during the first phase of free European settlement in Queensland, the Gayndah Racecourse is evidence for the importance and early development of the sport. Horse races were amongst the first organised sporting events in Australia and served as both a recreation and for the furtherance of horse breeding. This was important in an era when horses were used for transport, industry and warfare as well as for recreation. The first Derby held in Queensland was held on this track in 1868.
The establishment of a racecourse is part of the pattern of Gayndah's development as an early town, established in 1849 as a centre for the Burnett District.The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage.
The Gayndah Racecourse is uncommon as a mid nineteenth century horse racing track in Queensland and may have been in longer continuous regular use as a race track than any other in Queensland.The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.
The Gayndah Racecourse is important for its social value to Jockey Club members, trainers, owners and jockeys and with generations of racegoers from all walks of life, both in the surrounding area and from further afield.

== Operation of gene patents prior to invalidation ==


=== Awarding of BRCA1 and BRCA2 patents in US ===


==== Patentable subject matter ====
There are no special proscriptions for specific subject matter in US patent law, and Congress and the courts have consistently declined to enact limitations on patentable subject matter for specific industries. Accordingly, a DNA sequence, like other molecules, is eligible to be considered for patenting by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, provided that the patentee alters its environment or structure. Myriad Genetics' patent applications were eligible as the BRCA genes were isolated from their natural environment.


==== Tests ====
Under international standards, patentable matter must satisfy tests of novelty, inventive step and industrial application, to protect subject matter in the public domain. The industrial application step is the most difficult to meet under US patent law. A DNA sequence is only able to meet this criterion if a direct industrial use for the sequence can be identified. This would not have been difficult for Myriad Genetics to demonstrate in its BRCA patent applications, as its inventions were designed for the purposes of testing subjects for their susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancers.
International trade law dictates that a country can apply no additional tests in evaluating patentability, and must apply these tests without discriminating against biological inventions. Therefore, ethics-based criteria would not have factored into the USPTO's decision to allow Myriad Genetics to patent the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.


==== Scope of awarded patents ====
Myriad Genetics' BRCA patents have broad scope in the US. The company's claims consist of harmful mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, the use of the mutations to diagnose and screen for breast and ovarian cancers, and the development of treatments for these cancers.: 132 


=== Application of BRCA1 and BRCA2 patents in US market ===


==== Monopolistic behaviour ====
Although Myriad Genetics is one of few gene patent holders to seek infringement litigation against its patents and has only done so twice, the existing threat of litigation, according to anecdotal evidence from some laboratories, has been sufficient to keep competitors in the US from challenging Myriad Genetics' monopoly on BRCA gene testing. As a result, the company's monopoly may inhibit research and prevent the development of improvements in breast cancer testing technology.: 139  A counter-argument is that gene patents encourage innovation because patents can provide financial rewards.


==== Accessibility of BRCA testing ====
Myriad Genetics has used sequencing of the BRCA genes to develop a test for hereditary breast and ovarian cancers, which it markets to laboratories as BRACAnalysis.: 130  As at 2010, the test costs US$3,400, which is three times the cost of pre-patented testing. The company currently has agreements with major health organisations in the US and international licensing agreements for exclusive provisions.: 136  Consequently, individuals wishing to be tested for breast or ovarian cancer predisposition would be unable to circumnavigate Myriad Genetics' prices either within the US or by seeking testing abroad. Accessibility therefore remains an issue, despite the widespread availability of testing.


=== Awarding of BRCA1 and BRCA2 patent licenses in Australia ===


==== Patentable subject matter ====
Although Australia's Patents Act 1990, prohibits patenting 'human beings and the biological processes for their generation',: p 105 </ref> in recent times virtually no class of patent matter has been held unpatentable by the courts. Like the USPTO, the Australian Patent Office accepts applications for human gene and gene sequences, provided that they have been separated from the human body.: p 105  In Bristol-Myers Squibb, Finkelstein J declared that it was up to the Australian Parliament to amend the Patents Act 1990 if it did not consider medical treatment patentable.: p 108  In 2015, the High Court of Australia unanimously ruled that isolated nucleic acid does not qualify as proper subject matter for patent protection. This decision moves Australia's laws regarding patentable subject matter closer towards those of the US.


==== Tests ====
Under section 18 of the Patents Act 1990, a patent can only be granted if the subject matter is a manner of manufacture (invention) within section 6 of the Statute of Monopolies 1623, which is novel and involves an inventive step when compared to the prior art base, and is useful.: p 99  In light of the absence of special treatment for biotechnology-related processes, and the innovativeness and usefulness of its patents, it is unlikely that Genetic Technologies' BRCA licenses could be successfully contested under Australian patent law.


==== Challenges to license validity ====
Under section 46 of the Trade Practices Act 1974, a corporation with a substantial degree of market power is prohibited from taking advantage of its power to substantially damage competition.: p 122  However, recent court decisions have been reluctant to apply this section to invalidate patents. For example, in Warman International v Envirotech Australia Pty Ltd, Wilcox J held that ""to exercise in good faith an extraneous legal right, though the effect may be to lessen, or even eliminate competition, is to take advantage of that right, not of market power."" Given the broad claims of gene sequence patents, such as the BRCA patents licensed to Genetic Technologies, and the courts' limited regard for anti-competition provisions, it is unlikely that Genetic Technologies' monopoly could be contested under the Trade Practices Act 1974. This could potentially limit the availability of products and processes related to the BRCA genes.: p 128 


=== Application of BRCA1 and BRCA2 patent licenses in Australian market ===


==== Monopolistic behaviour ====
Genetic Technologies has had less success than Myriad Genetics in enforcing its exclusive rights to BRCA gene testing in its home country. Genetic Technologies has made multiple attempts to force other laboratories to stop performing BRCA tests, but yielded to public pressure to cease its attempts.


==== Accessibility of BRCA Testing ====
The Australian Law Reform Commission has declined to recommend amendments to gene patent and licensing laws on the basis that there is a lack of evidence that gene patenting and licensing has significantly affected Australian health care costs. The BRCA test would have cost A$2,100 through Genetic Technologies, but public laboratory BRCA tests are subsidised by the federal government.Genetic Technologies' failure to enforce its patent rights may embolden other players in the biomedical industry to pursue research and development related to patented gene sequences. Conversely, it could serve as a demotivator for Genetic Technologies. The effects of gene patents on development in the medical industry will become clearer when an Australian Senate inquiry report is released in June 2010.

On 29 March 2010, Judge Robert Sweet of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York found that there was no evidence Myriad Genetics went to any great length in inventing a process to isolate the genes in question. As such he dismissed the case on a summary hearing in favour of the plaintiff, the American Civil Liberties Union, as being the 'longest of long shots'. Justice Sweet found no evidence which could be considered by a jury in favour of the defendant, and dismissed the argument that the gene should be patented on the basis that it was isolated from the human body, referring to the practice as a 'lawyers trick'. Myriad Genetics has claimed it will appeal the decision up to the US Supreme Court to obtain an authoritative and binding decision, which they have lost as of 15 June 2013.Myriad Genetics has a number of possible arguments that it could put forward in any forthcoming appeals, and will likely be focussing on the law surrounding validation of gene patents based on their isolation. The company argues that the fact that it has been able to isolate the genes should be considered. This is a direct derivative of the black letter law which states that if the gene was newly isolated and characterised, then it was not a mere discovery; it was an industrially applicable technical solution to a technical problem.Conversely, the notion that the patenting of human genes is invalid may have support in the decision reached in the Howard Florey/Relaxin case, where an attempt was made to take out a patent on a naturally occurring human hormone. The verdict from this case stated that 'to find a substance freely occurring in nature is a mere discovery and therefore not patentable. However, if the substance found in nature has first to be isolated from its surroundings and a process for obtaining it is developed, that process is patentable.'


=== Implications of the court's decision on the US industry ===
The President and CEO of Myriad Genetics, Peter Meldrum, claims that the existence of gene patents and their granting to young start-up biotechnology companies is crucial for the development of the industry. He said that the decision to invalidate the patents would stifle the industry by not giving the needed support and incentives for biotechnology start-ups. The American Civil Liberties Union counters that with the patents now invalidated, the industry will prosper due to the gene or DNA in question now not being reserved exclusively for a particular group of industry participants.


=== Relevance of the US court decision to Australia ===
The US court decision will have no official bearing on Australian percent as the jurisdictions are entirely separate, and as such the doctrine of stare decesis will not apply. However, the close alignment of the two countries' legal systems and business interests may signal knock-on effects in Australia, with the potential for the US verdict to establish persuasive precedent.
The stance of the Australian Government and subsequent policy decisions regarding the validity of gene patents are likely to be shaped by two competing issues; one being the government's objective to encourage innovation, and the other of whether to follow a trend to allow the legal patenting of human genes, as has been the case in the US.


== Australian policy direction on gene patents ==


=== Australian Law Reform Commission report ===
A report into human genes and health was released by the ALRC in 2004. It contained 50 key recommendations, none of which were directed solely at the patenting of genetic materials and technologies; proposing specific laws for genetic materials and technologies may have implications for Australia's compliance with various obligations under several international trade agreements. Recommendations were directed at improvements in the patent system more generally, with many encouraging greater utilisation of existing mechanisms currently within the Patents Act 1990 and the Trade Practices Act 1974. The report explicitly recommended that social or ethical concerns should not be added as unequivocal grounds for excluding an invention from patentability under the Patents Act 1990. The ALRC did concede, however, that arguments in favour of a ban on genetic information were 'attractive'.The ALRC's report focussed on a number of areas and detailed recommendations on how each of these areas could be improved. A significant section of the report was Part B: Patent Laws and Practices, which describes the system of obtaining, maintaining and challenging patent protection in Australia, providing international comparisons where relevant.
The ALRC concluded that inventions involving genetic materials and technologies should be assessed according to the same legislative criteria as other inventions, however it found that gene patents do highlight issues of an invention's 'usefulness' under Australian law. In response to this concern, the ALRC recommended reforms to increase the burden of proof on applicants to show 'usefulness' during the standard patent application process. The fundamental idea behind this is to enable registered patents to withstand potential challenges. Such a recommendation is reliant on the development of specific guidelines to assist patent examiners in applying any revised 'usefulness' requirements.
A striking finding of the ALRC report was that due to existing impediments to amending the Patents Act 1990 such as international treaty obligations and the reliance of the biotechnology industry on patents for revenue, the Act 'should not be amended to exclude genetic materials or technologies for, patentability; or to provide a new medical treatment exclusion; or to expand the existing circumstances in which social and ethical considerations may be taken into account in decisions about granting patents'. Given the size and nature of the Australian biotechnology industry, such a conclusion was likely expected, as patent licensing is particularly important to facilitate further research. Additionally, as evidence at the time did not suggest that restrictive licensing practices were pervasive in the industry, it was consequently recommended that the nation's peak industry body, AusBiotech Ltd, should develop model licensing agreements for the industry. Recommendations did not extend to a statutory licensing scheme.
Another major recommendation of the ALRC was to amend the Trade Practices Act 1974 to clarify the relationship between Part IV of the Act and international property rights. Moreover, healthcare bodies were urged to make use of existing complaint procedures under the TPA, especially where evidence of anti-competitive conduct existed.
Overall, the ALRC report's recommendations do not require legislative change, but rather they involve the development of revised guidelines or alternative action by the government and/or non-governmental organisations.


=== Australian Senate inquiry ===
Further debate and discussion surrounding the issue of gene patentability was conducted between 2008 and 2010 by the Australian Senate Community Affairs Committee with its Inquiry into Gene Patents.
Noteworthy submissions such as that from Cancer Council Australia urged the government to outright exclude gene sequences and other related findings from the definition of patentable subject matter, as a long-term solution to increasing cost and access problems associated with patented genetic material. The submission details how gene patenting can actively discourage scientific research and discovery to a larger extent that it rewards innovation. While conceding that legislative action alone is not an effective long-term solution, the Cancer Council stresses the importance of increasing the availability of resources to the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission. This proposed solution is in line with the ALRC's report recommendation for a more extensive application of the Trade Practices Act 1974.These views were not shared by the Australian biotechnology industry, as represented by AusBiotech. AusBiotech's submission to the inquiry sends a message to the Senate that such patents have global relevance across the industry, and further details how the need for patent protection in the biotechnology industry is the starting point for the development of potential products. The submission concluded that any proposed amendment to current legislation would prevent a significant proportion of the Australian biotechnology industry from protecting innovations, resulting in an adverse effect on potential commercialisation opportunities and reduced investment. The end result would be argued as having a detrimental effect on the Australian healthcare and medical research industries.
In 2010, the Senate Community Affairs Reference Committee inquiry into Gene Patents concludes. A divided Committee did not support a ban on human genetic materials but rejects IP Australia's justification for patenting genetic information.Senator Bill Heffernan, a minority member of the committee, introduces a private members bill to ban the patenting of human genetic materials and 'biological materials' drafted with the assistance of Sydney-based IP lawyer and academic, Dr Luigi Palombi.Senator Heffernan's Patents Amendment (Human Genes and Biological Materials) Bill 2010 was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for review in 2011 and rejected after fierce lobbying by the pharmaceutical industry. At the inquiry, Australia's Department of Health and Ageing presented evidence supporting the ""intention"" of the Bill, but not its specific language.


=== Possible causes of action ===
The case for invalidation of gene patents in Australia seems unlikely, chiefly because of the growing nature of the biotechnology industry and its inherently high dependence on patents.
Existing invalidation mechanisms in the Patents Act 1990 seem to offer little assistance in the matter. Section 50(1)(a) of the Act gives the Commissioner of Patents the discretion to reject a patent application on the grounds that the use of the invention would be contrary to law. In deciding whether to exercise this discretionary power, an examiner must have close regard to whether an invention is primarily intended for an unlawful use. Gene patents are generally described to have a lawful use for their invention, thus they have not been excluded on this ground. As at May 2010, no Australian regulation makes the use of gene-related inventions unlawful.As a member of the World Trade Organization, Australia is required to comply with the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) agreement, that specifically requires patents to be made available for all fields of technology without discrimination. Any attempt by Australian legislators to alter the Patents Act 1990 by introducing a higher threshold of patentability or a general exclusion for gene technologies may breach obligations under TRIPS. While TRIPS does offer some provisions for exceptions, the full impact of these sections would adversely affect the level of domestic innovation and cross-country trading.

== Career ==


=== Club career ===
Curiale is the son of Sicilian parents originally from Campobello di Mazara who emigrated to Germany in the 1980s. He started playing football at the age of 5 for local Cologne team SV Mülheim-Nord. Noted in 2004 by former Palermo and Udinese star Giovanni Montalbano, head coach of Eccellenza club Salemi at the time, during a summer beach soccer tournament in Campobello, he accepted to sign for the club, but left it soon after to join Campobello, another Eccellenza team, in November 2004. He scored nine goals for Campobello, helping them to win Eccellenza Sicily and ensure a historical first promotion to Serie D. From 2005 to 2007, he played for Palermo Primavera, notably scoring 28 goals in the 2006–07 season with the Under-20 team, being instrumental in helping the rosanero youth team to reach the Campionato Nazionale Primavera semi-final, then lost to Inter Milan.On 5 June 2007, Palermo loaned him out to Sambenedettese of Serie C1 in order to let him achieve some first team experience. With Samb, Curiale played a total of 29 matches, scoring nine goals, and being instrumental in the team's escape from relegation.
Following his impressive experience with Sambenedettese, Curiale received some interest from a number of Serie B teams. In July 2008, Palermo and Vicenza agreed a one-year loan for the young striker. As he did not manage to gain a regular first team place with Vicenza (only playing three games in the first half of the season), he returned to Palermo in January 2009 in order to be loaned to another team, Ravenna Calcio of Lega Pro Prima Divisione, for the remainder of the season. Curiale started impressively his second playing experience in the Italian third tier, becoming instrumental in Ravenna's rise in the league table by scoring eight goals in eight matches before suffering a muscle injury that will keep him out for two months.Curiale then spent the 2009–10 season on loan to Serie B club Cittadella; he made a total 20 appearances during the regular season, scoring three goals.In July 2010, he was sent out on loan again, this time to Serie B club Crotone; the club will also have an option to buy half of the player's registration rights at the end of the season.On 31 August 2011, he moved to Triestina. Later in January 2012 he joined Serie B club Grosseto, but played only 14 games in one year with the club. He successively left to join Lega Pro Prima Divisione club Frosinone in January 2013, and won promotion to Serie B with his new club in June 2014.
In January 2015, he was signed by Trapani Calcio for €150,000.In August 2015, he moved to Lecce on loan. He scored 4 goals in 18 appearances before heading back to Trapani.
On 28 September 2020, he joined Catanzaro on a two-year contract.On 31 January 2022, Curiale signed with Vibonese.


=== International career ===
Curiale played three games with the Italian under-20 team in March and April 2008.

== Flight ==

The aircraft departed from Kunming Changshui International Airport for Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport at 13:15 local time (05:15 UTC) and was scheduled to land at 15:05 (07:05 UTC). The aircraft had been scheduled to travel earlier from Baoshan to Kunming, but this segment of the journey was temporarily suspended due to low passenger numbers as a result of COVID-19.According to the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), contact with the aircraft was lost over the city of Wuzhou. At 14:22 (06:22 UTC), while approaching its top of descent into Guangzhou, the aircraft entered a sudden steep descent from 29,100 feet (8,900 m). It briefly leveled off and climbed up from 7,400 ft (2,300 m) to 8,600 ft (2,600 m), but then plunged downwards again, reaching a final recorded altitude of 3,225 ft (983 m) less than two minutes after the beginning of the descent, with a maximum descent rate of nearly 31,000 feet (9,400 m) per minute. The aircraft crashed in the mountainous regions of Teng County, where a debris field was subsequently discovered. Chinese media reported that the plane had disintegrated and caused a fire destroying bamboo in the area.The crash was filmed by the security camera of a local mining company. Residents of the villages surrounding the crash site heard a loud explosion. Footage from the crash site taken in the aftermath of the incident showed wreckage and a fire. Many smaller pieces of wreckage were scattered in the surrounding area. All of the plane's occupants died in the crash.


== Aircraft ==
The aircraft involved was a Boeing 737-89P (737NG or 737 Next Generation) with the registration B-1791 and serial number 41474. The aircraft was powered by two CFM56-7B26E turbofans. It was first flown on 5 June 2015 and was delivered new to China Eastern Airlines on 25 June 2015. It was painted in the airline's Yunnan Peacock livery.The 737-800 has a solid safety record, with 11 previous fatal accidents (the first in September 2006) out of more than 7,000 planes delivered since 1997. It is not equipped with the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) used on the newer 737 MAX that led to two fatal accidents in 2018 and 2019 and the grounding of the fleet.


== Passengers and crew ==
The CAAC and the airline later reported 123 passengers and 9 crew members to be on the flight, for a total of 132 people. All passengers were Chinese.The flight crew consisted of three pilots, five flight attendants, and an in-flight security guard.

Captain Yang Hongda had been employed as a Boeing 737 pilot since January 2018, with a total of 6,709 flight hours.
First officer Zhang Zhengping was amongst China's most experienced commercial pilots, with 31,769 hours, and a flight instructor for China Eastern, having trained more than 100 captains; he was awarded the honorary title ""Meritorious Pilot"" of civil aviation in 2011.
Second officer (as observer) Ni Gongtao, with a total of 556 flight hours, was aboard to fulfill training duties.


== Emergency response and recovery ==
Local authorities dispatched 450 firefighters to the scene of the accident. Firefighters were dispatched by the Wuzhou Fire and Rescue Department at 15:05 CST. At 15:56, firefighters from nearby Tangbu arrived and performed reconnaissance, and at 16:40, firefighters from outside Wuzhou were dispatched from Guilin, Beihai, Hezhou, Laibin and Hechi.

Rescue crews had difficulty accessing the site because the crash caused a forest fire, which was extinguished by 17:25. By evening, 117 rescuers out of 650 dispatched had arrived, and headed to the site from three directions. Aircraft wreckage and belongings of occupants were found, but there were no signs of human bodies or remains. Workers used hand equipment, detection dogs and UAVs to try to locate the flight recorders and human remains, finding one flight recorder on 23 March. The crash site was generally concentrated within a 30-metre (98 ft) radius where most of the wreck was found. Rescue workers also found a 1.3-metre-long (4 ft 3 in) wreckage fragment, supposedly part of the aircraft, 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from the main site.Wet weather and the challenging accessibility of the crash site hampered the recovery process. Heavy rain partially filled the impact crater with water which had to be pumped away. Recovery activities were suspended on the morning of 23 March due to the threat of landslides.


== Investigation ==
The CAAC enabled an emergency task force and dispatched a team to the crash site. Liu Ning, secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Guangxi, went to the scene of the crash and ordered an ""all-out"" search and rescue operation. He was accompanied by the director of the Standing Committee of the People's Congress of the Guangxi and other officials.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the United States said that it was made aware of the incident and that it was ""ready to assist in investigation efforts"" if requested. Boeing said that it was informed by initial reports and was gathering details. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) of the United States said that a senior official had been appointed as representative to the accident inquiry. Representatives from CFM International, Boeing, and the FAA will also act as technical advisers in the probe. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said on 23 March that Chinese authorities had invited the NTSB to take part in the investigation. COVID-19 quarantine regulations may hamper the access of U.S. investigators to mainland China.One of the two flight recorders was found on 23 March. It had suffered external damage, and it was initially unknown whether it was the flight data recorder (FDR) or the cockpit voice recorder (CVR). It was later identified as the latter, and the storage device was believed to be ""relatively intact"". It was sent to Beijing for possible data extraction.

Mao Yanfeng, head of aircraft investigation at the CAAC stated the flight had not encountered dangerous weather conditions.On 26 March it was announced that the identities of 120 victims  had been determined using DNA technology. The emergency locator transmitter (ELT) was retrieved, close to where the FDR was installed, but the team was still seeking the data module from the FDR itself. Additionally, no components from common explosives were detected.On 27 March local media outlets stated that a second flight recorder had been recovered and was confirmed by experts as the FDR. It was located on the slope of the crash site, and buried 1.5 metres (5 ft) deep in the soil.


== Reactions ==


=== Domestic ===
Chinese premier Li Keqiang called for all-out efforts to search for survivors and treat the injured and emphasized the need to reassure and serve the families of the victims. Chinese leader Xi Jinping called for investigators to determine the cause of the crash as soon as possible and to ensure ""absolute"" aviation safety.China Eastern issued a statement that a hotline for family members to contact the airline had been established. The airline announced that its Boeing 737-800 fleet would be grounded for inspection until the investigation of the crash was completed.VariFlight reported that nearly 74 percent of the scheduled 11,800 flights on 22 March were cancelled as a result of the crash. A majority of flight services between Beijing and Shanghai were cancelled. Cancellation rates in China were the highest of 2022. Nearly 89 percent of all China Eastern flights were cancelled on 22 March.


=== International ===
A number of world leaders expressed condolences for the loss of life in the crash.In India, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) placed all Boeing 737 aircraft flown by SpiceJet, Vistara and Air India Express under ""enhanced surveillance"". An official from the regulatory body said that ""safety is serious business,"" and that the situation was being closely monitored.On U.S. stock markets, Boeing shares initially fell by 7.8 percent and China Eastern shares by 8.2 percent after the incident. On the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, China Eastern shares dropped 6.5 percent.Boeing offered its condolences to the families of the victims and said that it was in contact with China Eastern and the NTSB.

== Biography ==
Balcomb (John Wesley) Greene was born on May 22, 1904, Millville, New York.
He studied from 1922 to 1926 at Syracuse University, where he received his BA degree. In 1927 he studied English literature at Columbia University. Greene taught English literature at Dartmouth College from 1928 to 1931. In 1931 he went to Paris and studied art at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière.
Soon after his return to New York in 1933, he realized that his true interest was painting. He started ""to work for the Emily Francis Contemporary Gallery, a non-profit organization that showed particular interest in American artists and had exhibited the work of Bradley Walker Tomlin and Mark Tobey."" In 1935 he became the first president of the Artists Union and in 1936 the first chairman of the American Abstract Artists (AAA). In the late 1930s he was employed by the New York mural division of the Federal Art Project (WPA), and completed abstract murals for the Williamsburg Houses (Brooklyn Museum, on long-term loan from the New York City Housing Authority) and the Public Health Building of the 1939 New York World's Fair (destroyed). Also in 1939 and 1941 he was re-elected as chairman of American Abstract Artists, but resigned from that organization in 1942, when he began a career as a professor of art history and aesthetics.
After receiving his master's degree in art history (New York University, 1943), Greene taught at Carnegie Institute of Technology, Pittsburgh, while also continuing to pursue a career as an artist. Gertrude Greene stayed in New York, and the couple shared a studio on Montauk, Long Island, during summer breaks. Greene worked alone to pursue his solitary style but at the same time, he was familiar with the Abstract Expressionist movement. He wrote in Art News, ""The Fourth Illusions, or Hunger for Genius"" ""A picture is painted of modern art that arranges all participants into movements, like well-behaved Englishmen in clubs."" In spite of his conviction, he agreed to participate in the invitational New York Painting and Sculpture Annuals organized by the New York School artists in 1954, 1955 and 1957. In 1972 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member.
Greene granted interviews to Jacqueline Moss, who was researching his wife for her master's thesis, published in 1980.Balcomb Greene died November 12, 1990, in Montauk Point, New York.

== Plot ==
Montana housewife Hattie O'Malley boards a train bound for New York because she's on her way to collect a prize she's won from a radio program. Getting on board in Chicago is criminal attorney John J. Malone, whose client, Steve Kepplar, just released from prison in Joliet, still owes him $10,000.
Suspicion exists that Kepplar himself will be on the train, heading to New York to retrieve $100,000 he previously stashed from a robbery. Chicago detective Tim Marino is a passenger. So is the ex-convict's business partner, Myron Brynk, and his moll, a looker named Lola.
Kepplar is indeed along for the ride, disguised as a sailor. Lola is in on it, hiding him in her compartment. But soon his dead body is found, followed by hers. More and more, the detective comes to believe lawyer Malone and even Hattie could be involved in this, but Brynk turns out to be the man he's after.


== Story origins and pre-production ==
In the 1930s and '40s, MGM produced the ""Thin Man"" series of six films, based on Dashiell Hammett's novel. It was very popular with American audiences for all 13 years of its run.
In the late 1940s, MGM decided to try to repeat its success with the help of Craig Rice, one of the leading mystery writers of the time. She was famous for her stories featuring fast-talking lawyer John J. Malone, who often cut ethical corners while solving crimes. MGM also approached Stuart Palmer, another famous mystery writer of the era. Together, Rice and Palmer wrote a short story titled ""Once Upon a Train (The Loco Motive)"", teaming Malone with Palmer's most famous character, Hildegarde Withers, who had appeared previously in films in the 1930s. However, MGM replaced the character of Withers with that of ""Mrs. O'Malley"" due to copyright issues with the publisher of Palmer's stories.
Director Norman Taurog was chosen by MGM to direct the film adaptation, as it was a screwball comedy/mystery, a strength of his. However, instead of letting Palmer and Rice write the screenplay, he delegated the duties to William Bowers. Bowers' screenplay resembled the short story that Rice and Palmer had written, so the elements of comedy and mystery that Rice included in her works were preserved in the film adaptation.

Battle of Kopidnadon,"['780s conflicts', '780s in the Byzantine Empire', '788', '8th century in the Abbasid Caliphate', 'Articles with short description', 'Battles in medieval Anatolia', 'Battles involving the Abbasid Caliphate', 'Battles involving the Byzantine Empire', 'Battles of the Arab–Byzantine wars', 'Byzantine Cappadocia', 'CS1 German-language sources (de)', 'Coordinates on Wikidata', 'Good articles', 'Harun al-Rashid', 'Short description matches Wikidata', 'Webarchive template wayback links']","The Battle of Kopidnadon or Kopidnados took place in September 788 between the armies of the Abbasid Caliphate and the Byzantine Empire. The Abbasid army launched an invasion of Byzantine Asia Minor, and was confronted by a Byzantine force at Kopidnadon. The resulting battle was an Abbasid victory. Among the Byzantine losses was a certain Diogenes, who is identified by some scholars with the probable original source for the literary hero Digenes Akritas.

","The Battle of Kopidnadon or Kopidnados took place in September 788 between the armies of the Abbasid Caliphate and the Byzantine Empire. The Abbasid army launched an invasion of Byzantine Asia Minor, and was confronted by a Byzantine force at Kopidnadon. The resulting battle was an Abbasid victory. Among the Byzantine losses was a certain Diogenes, who is identified by some scholars with the probable original source for the literary hero Digenes Akritas.


== Background ==
Ever since the failure of the last Arab attempt to conquer the Byzantine capital Constantinople, regular, almost annual raids were undertaken by the Caliphate's forces into Byzantine Asia Minor. In 782, a major invasion led by the Abbasid heir apparent, the future Harun al-Rashid (r. 786–809), resulted in a humiliating settlement for Byzantium, which was forced to sue for a truce in exchange for an annual payment of 160,000 gold nomismata. In 785, Empress-regent Irene of Athens resolved to cease the payment of the tribute, and warfare recommenced. The Arabs raided the Armeniac Theme, but in early 786 the Byzantines retaliated by sacking and razing to the ground the fortress town of Hadath in Cilicia, which the Abbasids had spent the last five years turning into a major stronghold and military base for their cross-border expeditions against Byzantium.


== Battle ==
With Harun al-Rashid's accession in 786, the raids launched over the next two years were relatively minor affairs; the first great invasion of the new reign occurred in 788, when a large expeditionary force crossed the Cilician Gates into the Anatolic Theme. Although the raid is not mentioned in Arabic sources, its description by the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor points to a major invasion, as it was confronted by the forces of the two most powerful Byzantine thematic armies, those of the Anatolic Theme itself and of the Opsician Theme.The site of the battle is called ""Kopidnadon"" in Theophanes, a name otherwise unattested. Modern scholars, beginning with Henri Grégoire in 1932, have identified it with the town of Podandos, on the western exit of the Cilician Gates. According to the brief account of Theophanes, the battle ended in a bloody defeat for the Byzantines, who lost many men and officers, including members of the tagma of the Scholai who had been banished to the provinces by Irene in 786 for their continued support of Iconoclasm. Theophanes also singles out the loss of the capable officer Diogenes, a tourmarches (division commander) of the Anatolics.


== Impact ==
The immediate impact of the Byzantine defeat seems to have been negligible; losses were heavy but not unbearable, and the level of devastation of the region seems not to have been excessive. In material terms, there is therefore little to distinguish the defeat at Kopidnadon from the ""typical"" Arab raid. It marks, however, a recommencement of large-scale border warfare after the relative lull since 782, which continued unabated until Harun's death in 809 and the subsequent Abbasid civil war.Perhaps the most long-term consequence of the battle was the death of the tourmarches Diogenes: by virtue of his unusual prominence in Theophanes's account, Henri Grégoire identified this Diogenes with the original archetype for the later epic hero Digenes Akritas.

The society has an international membership and its aims are to establish and maintain standards of typography and to provide a forum for debate.


== History ==
The ISTD was originally formed as the British Typographers' Guild (BTG) in 1928, when Vincent Steer and friends met in a Sicilian restaurant in Holborn, to found the society. Steer recognized the need and the potential for the creative typographer's skills in a world where most 'design' was carried out through compositors' layouts. From his own background in printing, and the opportunity to observe the trade in America, he determined to develop the profession of typography in the UK, and to that end started the British Typographers Guild with six other like-minded founding members.In 1953 the guild became the Society of Typographic Designers (STD), and in 1999, recognizing its influence in other countries, and at the behest of then President Colin Banks, it became the International Society of Typographic Designers (ISTD).


== TypoGraphic ==
TypoGraphic is the journal of the ISTD and was first published in 1971. Selected writings from 30 years of TypoGraphic were published in an anthology in 2001.A complete set of TypoGraphic journals is available at the St Bride Library.


== ISTD International Typographic Awards ==
The ISTD runs the International Typographic Awards which are held as an appraisal of current standards in typographic design and are judged by some of today's leading graphic, interactive and typographic design specialists:
A Certificate of Excellence, awarded to all finalists, signifies a high standard of design in conjunction with a high standard of typography.
Premier Awards, awarded to designers of outstanding submissions, are offered for work that has not only met the criteria for the award of a Certificate of Excellence, but which is also considered outstanding by a majority of the jurors.
The winning submission, selected from all of the Premier Awards, is judged to be the most significant typographical achievement, exemplifying excellence.The ISTD Awards are held every three years: there were awards in 2011 and 2014, and as of 2016 the next award will be given during 2017.


== Categories of membership ==
The ISTD has several categories of membership, some with designatory postnominals:

Honorary Fellowship (HonFISTD) is awarded in recognition of outstanding typographic design work, or significant contribution to the aims of, or service to, the ISTD or the typographic industry.
Fellowship (FISTD) is awarded in recognition of the nominee's professional standing or for their services to the ISTD.
Membership (MISTD) is open to all practising typographers, graphic designers, and educators who show, by submission of their typographic design work, or through evidence of competence in their field of activity, that their professional ability has reached the high standard required by the ISTD.
Student Membership is open to students who are successful in the Student Assessment.
Corporate Membership  is open to design organizations, companies, and other commercial institutions to support the ISTD.
Institutional Membership is open to educational institutions involved in the delivery of typographic studies. This offers a range of benefits including reduced submission fees for students submitting projects for assessment and teaching materials from the ISTD education archive.


== ISTD Student Assessment ==
The annual Student Assessment, started in 1975, allows students to gain entry to the ISTD. This is achieved by assessment of their work applied to a rigorous brief (five new project briefs are published in October each year), and is open to those registered on a recognised full-time undergraduate or postgraduate course. Assessment is carried out by teams of practicing designers and typographic educators.
Student Assessments are held in England, Ireland, Middle East, South Africa and Australia to deal with the submissions relating to each location. These are coordinated by the ISTD Education Team under the aegis of the Education Director.

== History ==


=== World War II ===

Marine Fighting Squadron 311 (VMF-311) was first commissioned on 1 December 1942 under Major Ralph K. Rottet, assigned to the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing and headquartered at MCAS Cherry Point.: 1  Quickly transitioning from a training squadron flying the SNJ Texan to a combat squadron flying the F4U Corsair, VMF-311 participated in what was one of the earliest American catapult operations involving the Corsair when 21 F4Us launched from USS Nassau on October 6, 1943. By this time the squadron formed part of MAG-31. During World War II, VMF-311 was one of the first to utilize and develop tactics for the Corsair in a ground attack mode, foreshadowing the squadron’s future role as an attack squadron. Indicative of its combat effectiveness the squadron destroyed 71 Japanese aircraft in a four-month period during the Battle of Okinawa in 1945. The end of World War II saw VMF-311 leaving Chimu Airfield on Okinawa to start occupational duty flying from Yokosuka airfield on Japan's mainland.


=== 1946-1950 ===

On September 17, 1945, the squadron landed at the Yokosuka Naval District to begin occupation duty in mainland Japan. Occupational duty in Japan lasted till May 1946, when MAG-31 was notified to prepare for the termination of its Japanese assignment; VMF-311 was going home.: 11  Between July 1946 and April 1947 the squadron had a sleeping existence and being transferred to MAG-32 and later MAG-12 while consisting of one officer, but in 1949 VMF-311 became the first West Coast Marine jet squadron when it started flying the TO-1 Shooting Star. Coincidentally the squadron was re-designated Marine Fighter Squadron 311 (VMF-311) and around that time acquired the code letters WL, phonetically pronounced as ""William Love,"" but from which also came the nickname ""Willy Lovers"".: 14  The squadron quickly transitioned to the F9F Panther in October 1949 and found itself once again preparing for war by November 1950, arriving once again at Yokusuka airfield in Japan.


=== The Korean War, 1950–1955 ===
 

Arriving in South Korea on December 7, 1950, VMF-311 was the first land-based Marine jet squadron to be used in combat providing close air support for the Marines and Soldiers on the ground. In late-June 1952 the squadron participate in the attack on the Sui-ho Dam. Additionally, the squadron pioneered strip-alert tactics still practiced today. Legendary pilots during this era included later astronaut and Senator John Glenn and baseball star Ted Williams. In over 2+1⁄2 years of action in Korea the squadron amassed 18,851 combat sorties. In 1957, the squadron finally was re-designated Marine Attack Squadron 311 (VMA-311). The nickname ""Tomcats"" was also bestowed during this era.


=== Vietnam War ===
The first A4D-2 Skyhawk was received in the summer of 1958, initiating 30 years of Skyhawk service. In May 1965 the squadron, now flying A-4Es, deployed to Chu Lai Air Base, South Vietnam and on June 2, they conducted their first combat mission of the Vietnam War. In August 1965, VMA-311  supported the 7th Marine Regiment in Operation Starlite, the first major American operation of the war.: 41  The squadron recorded a four-day sortie total of 240 from 5 to 8 May 1968 in support of their fellow marines during the Battle of Khe Sanh.The squadron moved to Danang Air Base in late July 1970.: 51  In early 1971 the squadron provided support for Operation Lam Son 719 the South Vietnamese offensive into Laos and was credited with destroying eight People's Army of Vietnam tanks.: 52  During may 1971 the squadron readied for redeployment, flying their last mission on 7 May before leaving South Vietnam on 12 May.: 52 The squadron rejoined Marine Aircraft Group 12 (MAG-12) at MCAS Iwakuni with the entire squadron redeployed by 27 May 1971.: 52  On 29 October the squadron deployed to Naha Air Base until 15 January 1972.: 53 On 16 May 1972 VMA-311 once again deployed to South Vietnam with MAG-12 Forward and VMA-211 to Bien Hoa Air Base in response to the North Vietnamese Easter Offensive. The squadron would support Army of the Republic of Vietnam forces fighting in the Battle of An Loc.: 53  Their final sortie in-country would occur on January 29, 1973, a day before they would drop the last ordnance from a Marine A-4 Skyhawk during the war. VMA-311 would fly 54,625 combat sorties during their time supporting operations in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.


=== The Gulf War ===
In 1988 VMA-311 received its first AV-8B Harrier and shortly thereafter headed into harm's way again. On August 11, 1990, after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, VMA-311 deployed in support of Operation Desert Shield, leading all other Marine fixed-wing squadrons into Saudi Arabia where they were based out of King Abdulaziz Naval Base. While there, the Tomcats were the most forward deployed fixed-wing squadron.  On January 17, 1991 while in support of Operation Desert Storm the squadron became the first to utilize the AV-8B in combat when a flight of four Harriers destroyed an Iraqi artillery position in support of the Battle of Khafji. During 43 days of air combat operations, Tomcat pilots flew 1,017 combat missions and delivered 840 tons of ordnance against enemy targets throughout Kuwait and Southern Iraq. 


=== Global War on Terror ===
On November 3, 2001, VMA-311 Harriers attached to the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit embarked aboard USS Peleliu became the first Harriers to fly combat missions in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom.
On January 15, 2003, VMA-311 deployed to the Northern Persian Gulf as part of Amphibious Task Force West.  On March 21, 2003, almost 59 years to the day after VMF-311’s first combat sortie in World War II, they flew their first combat sortie of Operation Iraqi Freedom. During the war they flew over 550 sorties while dropping 77 tons of precision ordnance, destroying or neutralizing 132 Iraqi targets while operating from two amphibious assault carriers, USS Bonhomme Richard and USS Tarawa. The squadron returned from the Persian Gulf on July 24, 2003.  In early 2005, the squadron deployed to Al Asad Air Base in Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, while simultaneously deploying a 6 jet 90 Marine detachment to MAG-12 in Iwakuni, Japan to support the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit.  In early 2008, the squadron made its final deployment to Al Asad Air Base in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, while simultaneously deploying a 6 jet detachment aboard the USS Peleliu (LHA 5) in support of the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit. The squadron's 2008 deployment to Iraq marked the Marine Corps Harrier's final participation in Operation Iraqi Freedom, and on 5 October 2008, VMA-311's aircraft were the last Harriers to fly combat missions in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. For the year 2008, VMA-311 had the distinction of being selected as the Marine Corps ""Attack Squadron of the Year"" by the Marine Corps Aviation Association (MCAA). Operation Iraqi Freedom deployments were soon followed in 2010 with deployments again to the 15th MEU and a Unit Deployment Program to the Pacific region. While there, they spent over two months aboard USS Essex with the 31st MEU while participating in the multilateral exercises Cobra Gold 2010 and Balikatan 2010. VMA-311 deployed to Camp Bastion, Helmand Province, Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom from April to September 2013.


=== Decommissioning & Future Plans ===
VMA-311 was decommissioned at MCAS Yuma on October 15, 2020.  The squadron plans to be recommissioned in 2022 in order to start transitioning to F-35Cs. The transition is due to be concluded by 2024.


== Squadron aces ==
The following Marines from VMA-311 have been credited as Flying aces:
2nd Lt. William P. Brown Jr. - 7.0
Maj. Michael R. Yunck - 7.0 (5.0 with VMA-311)
Maj. Perry L. Shuman - 6.0

== Controversy ==
In a child custody case, Judge Bradford approved a ruling of a magistrate forbidding either parent from instructing their son in their shared religious beliefs. The magistrate questioned how Wicca differed from Satanism and required the parents to shelter their child from ""non-mainstream religious beliefs and rituals"". This ruling was overturned on appeal.

It was founded in November 1889 by John Darling, a director of the Union Steamship Company of New Zealand, and nine local businessmen. The company began by offering local service on Burrard Inlet near Vancouver and later expanded to servicing the entire British Columbia coast.
The Union Steamship Company was bought out by the Canadian Pacific Steamship Company in 1948.  The SS Noronic fire in Toronto forced the Federal Maritime Department to change marine regulations regarding wooden passenger vessels, while the nature of the BC coastal fleet changed more to freight and a tug and barge operation. The Union Steamships ran until 1956 when a strike finished the fleet.","The Union Steamship Company of British Columbia was a pioneer firm on coastal British Columbia.

The Union Steamships ran until 1956 when a strike finished the fleet.


== Company organized ==
Union Steamship had its origins in the Burrard’s Inlet Towing Company, whose original principals were Alfred N.C. King, Hugh Stalker, John Morton, and Capt. Donald McPhaiden.  The fleet upon formation consisted of three smaller wooden-hulled steamers: Leonora, Senator, and, the largest of the three, the steam tug Skidegate.


== 1890 to 1896 ==
Cutch, 324 GT, 180 ft (54.86 m), was the first steamer the company acquired after its initial incorporation.  Cutch had been built at Hull, England in 1884.  Capt. William Webster, one of the founders of Union Steamship, located Cutch in India, where it had been in service as a maharaja’s yacht.  Webster purchased the steamer with funds raised in England by John Darling.  Webster brought Cutch from India to British Columbia, arriving in Vancouver in June 1890.  Cutch was placed on the run from Vancouver to Nanaimo, British Columbia.Capilano 1 and Coquitlam were built in Glasgow, Scotland and shipped to British Columbia in a knocked-down condition, then reassembled on the beach near present-day Stanley Park.  Capilano 1 was launched in December 1891, and Coquitlam followed in April 1892.


== 1897 to 1906 ==


=== Gold rush transportation ===
In 1897 the Klondike Gold Rush created a demand for transportation.  To meet the demand, both Capilano 1 and Coquitlam were outfitted with crude berths for passengers, and then run north to the mouth of the Yukon River.  Capilano 1 left in late July and Coquitlam in early August.  They were the first British vessels to proceed directly to the mouth of the Yukon from Vancouver.In 1898 Union Steamship placed Capilano 1, Coquitlam, and Cutch in service to Skagway and Dyea, in southeast Alaska.  Skagway and Dyea were the principal disembarkation point for traffic bound for the Klondike gold fields.  These three steamers remained in the Skagway/Dyea service in 1899.


=== Skidegate scrapped and Cutch wrecked ===
The company’s old steam tug Skidegate was scrapped in Vancouver in 1900.  Also in 1900, the company’s first steamer purchase, Cutch, was wrecked, on August 24, and sold for salvage.


=== Coutli and Camosun added to fleet ===
In 1904 the company built the steam tug Coutli, 99 GT, 71.4 ft (21.76 m) LOA, for use in log towing service for British Columbia Mills Co.In 1905 the company placed Camosun into service.  Camosun, 1,369 GT, 192 ft (58.52 m) LOA, was a steel-hulled modern vessel built at Paisley, Scotland by the Bow, McLachlan concern.  Camosun could carry 54 persons overnight, with room for 120 deck passengers.  Camosun arrived from Scotland in Vancouver on June 30, 1905 and was placed in service on a weekly route to Prince Rupert, BC under Capt. F. Saunders.


== 1907 to 1911 ==


=== Cowichen, Cheslakee, and Inlander added to fleet ===
In 1908 Union Steamship added Cowichan, 962 GT, 157 ft (47.85 m) LOA, to its fleet.  Cowichan, an all-steel vessel with twin propellers, was built in Troon, Scotland by Ailsa Shipbuilding Co.  Cowichan was licensed to carry 165 passengers and 125 tons of freight.  It was used in the company’s service to logging camps.Cheslakee, 526 GT, 132 ft (40.23 m) LOA, was completed for the company in 1910 by an Irish concern, Dublin Dockyard Co.  Built to the highest standards, the twin-propeller all-steel Cheslakee was intended to run out of Vancouver in passenger service on northern routes.  Cheslakee could carry only a limited amount of freight, which was restricted to perishable items such as butter, fruit and fish.  Passenger accommodations were large for a vessel of this size.Also in 1910 the company invested in the river sternwheeler Inlander.  Inlander ran for three seasons, 1910 to 1912, on the Skeena River.


=== Welsford & Company buys control of the company ===
In 1911 Welsford & Company, a Liverpool shipping line, purchased a controlling interest in Union Steamship Co.  Also in 1911, on September 23, the Welsford company purchased the Boscowitz Steamship Co., Ltd., of Victoria, BC, for $160,000, half in cash and half in Union Steamship stock.


== 1912 to 1918 ==
The start of World War I caused economic disruption and a fall off in the British Columbia salmon fishery, impacting the company’s operations so much that one-half of its fleet was taken out of service.  This soon changed, when wartime production demands generated an unprecedented surge in business.


=== Loss of ships in 1913 and 1914 ===
On June 7, 1913, disaster struck when Cheslakee capsized at its dock in Van Anda, on Texada Island, drowning several people.The company lost two ships in 1914.  On February 3, 1914 the company’s freighter Vadso, running a few hours out of Port Simpson, struck an uncharted rock, caught fire, and sank.  There were no casualties among the crew, but they had to row twelve miles to the Arrandale Cannery, from whence they were able to return to Vancouver on board another company freighter, Venture.  Later in 1914 Capilano 1 stranded in Malaspina Strait and became a total loss, but also with no casualties to anyone on board.


=== Purchase of the All-Red Line ===
The All-Red Line had been running local service from Vancouver to Powell River with the steamers Selma and Santa Maria.  The All-Red Line also owned property at Selma Park, on the Sunshine Coast of British Columbia, near the town of Sechelt.  In 1917 Union Steamship purchased the All-Red Line, including all of its floating equipment and the property at Selma Park.  Union Steamship renamed Selma as Chasina, and Santa Maria as Chilco.   Union Steamship later developed Selma Park as an excursion destination resort.


== 1919 to 1924 ==


=== Post-war expansion program ===
After World War I, the company, under manager Ernest H Beasley (or Beasley) (d.1920), began an expansion program.  The automobile had not yet been able reach most of the points served by the company’s steamers.  The company carried freight and passengers to new pulp mills at Powell River, Ocean Falls, and Swanson Bay.  The company also provided service to the Granby Copper Mine at Anyox, the gold mine at Surf Inlet (now Port Belmont), and the many coastal logging camps.


=== Death of company manager Beazley ===
There were periodic labor disputes in the Canadian shipping business after World War 1.
In May 1920 company manager Ernest H. Beazley was killed in an airplane crash at Minoru Park.  Beazley had just settled a labor strike, and was taking a brief vacation.  John Barnsley (d.1924), who had joined the company when the Boscowitz shipping concern was acquired, then became general manager, and R.A.H. Welsford came to British Columbia from Liverpool to act as managing director.


=== Two freighters purchased ===
In 1919 Union Steamship bought the freighter British Columbia from Griffiths, renamed it Chilliwack, and used it to replace the 1891 steamer Comox.  Comox was first resold for scrap, but soon sold again to a Central American concern and renamed Alejandro.The company also had the steel freighter Chilkoot 1 built in 1920 by Wallace Shipbuilding Co.  Chilkoot 1 remained in service for a long time, being operated in 1966 by Northland Navigation Co. under the name Alaska Prince.


=== Day excursion business developed ===
Union Steamship continued to develop the day excursion business which had begun in 1917 with the acquisition of the All-Red line.  In 1920, the company had the wooden steamer Capilano 2 built at B.C. Marine Ways, using engines from the Puget Sound steamer Washington.  Capilano 2 was intended to serve the resort at Selma Park, formerly owned by the All-Red Line.Lady Alexandra, completed at Montrose, Scotland was the most important addition to shipping in the Pacific Northwest in 1924.  Alexandra was a two-stack steamer of 1,396 GT and 230 feet, capable of carrying 1200 passengers on day excursions.  During the approximately 30 years Alexandra was in service, the steamer seldom left Howe Sound, and was mostly used during the summer months, including especially cruises to Bowen Island.


=== Terminal Steam Navigation purchased ===
In December 1920, Union Steamships bought the Terminal Steam Navigation Company from the veteran shipping man Capt. John Andrew “Jack” Cates for a price of about $250,000.  The sale included the Bowen Island property of Terminal Steam, the wooden steamer Bowena, and the route up East Howe Sound to Squamish.The deal was to have included the steamer Ballena, but before the sale was finalized, Ballena was destroyed by fire while alongside the Union dock in Vancouver, killing a coal stoker.  Bowena also sustained $15,000 damage from the same fire.  Following repair, Bowena was renamed Cheam, and placed in service on the Bowen Island route in May, 1921.


=== Cardena added to fleet ===
In 1923 Cardena 1559 GT 223 ft, was completed at Glasgow, Scotland for Union Steamship, which placed the new vessel on a route running from Vancouver to Prince Rupert, and then to Stewart, British Columbia.


== 1925 to 1929 ==


=== Celicia, Cynthia, and Catala added to fleet ===
In 1925 Union Steamships added three new steamers to its fleet, Lady Cecilia, Lady Cynthia, and Catala.  All were built by the same firm, Coaster Construction Co, at Montrose, Scotland.  Catala was an entirely new vessel, intended for northern service.Cecilia and Cynthia had been rebuilt from Royal Navy minesweepers.  They each had to be sponsoned out to improve their stability, but this reduced their speed from 19 to 15 knots.  Cecilia and Cynthia, each about 950 GT, were fitted to carry 800 passengers and 75 tons of freight on Howe Sound routes and to Powell River.  In later years Cynthia received substantial alterations for logging camp service.


=== Collision between Lady Cynthia and Cowichan ===
On December 27, 1925, Lady Cynthia collided with and sank another Union company ship, Cowichan’’.   Lady Cecilia had brought a Christmas excursion from Powell River to Vancouver.  More people wanted to come south than Cecilia could carry, so Harold Brown, the company's general manager, ordered Cynthia to embark an additional 200 passengers, after which Cynthia departed southbound for Vancouver.Meanwhile, northbound Cowichan encountered fog off Roberts Creek.  Knowing Cecilia would be coming, Cowichan’s Captain Robert Wilson, proceeded slowly, listened carefully for Cecilia 's whistle.  Cecilia passed safely by, but then Wilson was taken by surprise 15 minutes later when Cynthia, under Capt. John Boden appeared out of the fog, colliding with its bow into Cowichan’s amidships.Boden kept Cynthia’s bow in place to keep Cowichan from sinking.  Wilson, the last to leave his ship, first helped all 45 people on Cowichan to board Cynthia  When Cecila backed away, Cowichan sank almost immediately.


== 1938 to 1945 ==


=== Waterhouse concern acquired ===
In 1939 Union Steamship bought the ships and freighting interests of the Frank L. Waterhouse Co., which had been in the cannery service business for many years.  Vessels acquired were three freighters directly owned by Waterhouse, Northholm, Southholm, and Eastholm, and three more under charter, Gray, Bervin, and Salvor which was same vessel as the company’s old 1891 Coquitlam.The Waterhouse acquisitions were operated as a separate division of Union Steamships, under the management of R.L. Solloway.  Acquisition of the Waterhouse freighters brought the Union Steamship fleet to a total of 16 vessels.  At this time, all shipping on the Canadian west coast was operating under war time conditions, meaning blacked-out portholes, minimum lights, radio silence and in many cases, carrying guns manned by naval personnel.


=== Northholm lost in a storm ===
On January 16, 1943, the freighter Northholm was sunk in a storm off the west coast of Vancouver Island.  Northholm was struck by heavy seas, and sunk so quickly that nine men went down with the ship.  Eight men managed to escape the vessel, but of these, six later drowned, leaving the first officer and a seaman as the only survivors.


== 1946 to 1950 ==


=== Surplus warships acquired and converted ===
After World War II Union Steamships resumed regular weekly service to Ketchikan, Alaska after a lapse of many years, including stops en route at Prince Rupert and Ocean Falls.  To serve the route, the company had acquired three British-built corvettes, HMCS Leaside, HMS St. Thomas, and HMS Hespeler, and converted them into civilian passenger vessels Coquitlam 2, Camosun 3, and Chilcotin, respectively.  Originally the company intended to run on the route year-round, but winter traffic proved to be insufficient, so in December 1947 the Ketchikan run became seasonal only.


=== Chelosin stranded and sold to salvors ===
On November 4, 1949 Chelosin stranded off Siwash Rock near the entrance to Vancouver Harbor.  The company could not pull the ship off, and it was sold to salvors for $1,500.  All passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the vessel.  Victor David, who had bought Chelosin, surprised everyone when he and a five-man salvage crew were able to quickly refloat the ship and take it into a dock.

== Related polyhedra ==
It shares its vertex arrangement with the small stellated truncated dodecahedron and the uniform compounds of 6 or 12 pentagrammic prisms. It additionally shares its edge arrangement with the rhombicosidodecahedron (having the triangular and pentagonal faces in common), and with the small rhombidodecahedron (having the decagonal faces in common).


=== Dual ===

The dual polyhedron to the small dodecicosidodecahedron is the small dodecacronic hexecontahedron (or small sagittal ditriacontahedron). It is visually identical to the small rhombidodecacron. Its faces are darts. A part of each dart lies inside the solid, hence is invisible in solid models.

In addition, he served between 1997 and 2009 as President of the Central Committee of German Catholics (""Zentralkomitee der deutschen Katholiken"" / ZdK).


== Life ==
Hans Joachim Meyer was born in Rostock. He grew up, after 1945, in the Soviet occupation zone which was relaunched in October 1949 as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany).   After successfully completing his school studies in Rostock he moved to the Berlin area.  He attended the (East) German Academy for Laws (""Deutsche Akademie für Staats- und Rechtswissenschaft"") in Potsdam between 1955 and 1958 but was excluded after six terms before he could complete his degree because he ""failed to connect with the working class"" (wegen ""mangelnder Verbindung zur Arbeiterklasse"").  The real issue, he later told an interviewer, was his commitment to the Catholic Church.    His decision while still at school to join the CDU back in 1952, at a time when the ruling party was engaged in a robust campaign to take control of rival political parties, will already have drawn him to the attention of the authorities as a potential dissident in the making.   For the next year he worked as an ""assistant"" at the VEB Lokomotivbau Potsdam-Babelsberg (factory) as the nearby rail-locomotive plant was known at that time.   After that, resigning from the CDU in 1961, he was able to restart his university studies, now embarking on a course at the Humboldt University of Berlin of English and American Studies and Philology.   His decision to select a subject that was seen by the authorities as less directly political was vindicated, in that this time he was able to complete his course, emerging with his university degree in 1964.   He remained at the Humboldt as a teacher and senior research assistant between 1964 and 1982.  He received his doctorate in 1971.   His dissertation was, again, resolutely non-political:  it comprised a semantic analysis of the modern English verb prefix ""Up"" when compared to related prefixes in English and German (""Semantische Analyse der modernenglischen Verbalpartikel ""up"" im Vergleich zu verwandten englischen und deutschen Verbalpartikeln"").  Ten years later his habilitation, received in 1981, could have opened the way to a lifelong university career, had ""events"" not intervened.    He was assigned to the Foreign Languages section between 1973 and 1977, becoming deputy director for education and training.  Between 1978 and 1990 he headed up the Intensive Languages Training section at the Humboldt.   He also held an appointment as Professor of Applied Linguistics between 1985 and 1990.During his academic career in East Berlin Meyer was engaged with the church.  Between 1973 and 1975 he served as a member of the Dresden Pastoral Synod of the region covered by the German Democratic Republic.   Between 1976 and 1982 he worked with the Pastoral Council for the Bishopric in respect of East Berlin.During the later 1980s the winds of Perestroika blowing cross from, of all places, Moscow, found a growing resonance on the streets in the German Democratic Republic, (even if the government was appalled).   In November 1989 street protestors broke through the Berlin Wall, and it quickly became apparent that Fraternal Forces from the east had received no orders to intervene militarily.   There would be no repeat of 1953 or of the tragedy of 1968 in Prague.   A seemingly unstoppable series of events now unfolded leading to the country's first (and, as matters turned out, last) free and fair election.   In previous general elections, turn-pout had always been recorded at around 99% of eligible voters and the proportion of votes cast for the  ruling Socialist Unity Party had always been recorded at around 99% of votes cast.   However, results in March 1990 indicated significant levels of support for various political parties, with the CDU and its centre-right allies winning 48% of the votes.   Shorty after that Meyer received and accepted an invitation to join the new government headed up by Lothar de Maizière, despite not being at this stage a member of any political party, and despite not having stood for election to the national parliament (""Volkskammer"").   Between 12 April and 3 October 1990 Meyer served as the German Democratic Republic's last Minister for Minister for Education and the Arts.   His responsibilities included participation as leader of the East German delegation at the All-Germany Joint Education Commission between May and September 1990.   The commission was mandated to adapt an education system that would be implemented across a unified Germany. The commission's output was summarized in the Reunification Treaty (Articles 37 & 38) which came into force in October 1990 and was then implemented both at government level and on the ground.In August 1990 the East German CDU (party) formally merged back into the West German CDU from which it had been forcibly separated by the post-war division of Germany, and Hans Joachim Meyer took the opportunity to rejoin the party from which, out of ""disappointment over the party's limited political options"", he had resigned in 1961.  Directly following reunification he joined the regional government of Kurt Biedenkopf in Saxony, serving between November 1990 and May 2002 as Saxony's Minister of State for Sciences and the Arts.

== Career ==
Born in Marylebone in London, the son of psychiatrist Forbes Benignus Winslow and Susan Winslow née Holt, Winslow was possibly the most controversial psychiatrist of his time. As a boy he was brought up in lunatic asylums owned by his father, and was educated at Rugby School and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, transferring to Downing College at the University of Cambridge after four terms, where he took the MB degree in 1870. He was also a DCL(1873) of Trinity College Oxford and LL.D. of Cambridge University. A keen cricketer, Winslow captained the Downing College XI. In July 1864 he was a member of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) team which played against South Wales, in which team was W. G. Grace.In 1871 he was appointed a Member of the Royal College of Physicians (MRCP). He spent his medical career in an attempt to persuade the courts that crime and alcoholism were the result of mental instability. His attempt in 1878 to have Mrs Georgina Weldon committed as a lunatic at the instigation of her estranged husband William Weldon resulted in one of the most notorious court cases of the nineteenth century. The public notoriety the Weldon case caused earned him the displeasure of the medical establishment, which continued even after his death.
He became an adherent of the benefits of hypnotism in dealing with psychiatric cases. He took an active role in securing a reprieve for the four people sentenced to death for the murder by starvation of Mrs. Staunton at Penge in 1877. In 1878 he inquired into the mental condition of the Rev. Mr. Dodwell, who had shot at Sir George Jessel, the Master of the Rolls. Other trials in which Winslow was involved were those of Percy Lefroy Mapleton, convicted of the murder on the Brighton line; that of Florence Maybrick, and that of Amelia Dyer, the Reading baby farmer. He also appeared in many civil actions.


== Jack the Ripper ==

Winslow managed his father's asylums after his death in 1874, but these were removed from his control following a family feud, so he turned his attention to forensic work. Also in 1874 he changed his surname to Forbes-Winslow.
In 1888, with a little manipulation of the evidence, Winslow came to believe he knew the identity of Jack the Ripper, and believed that if he was given a team of six Police Constables he could catch the murderer.Winslow's suspect was Canadian G. Wentworth Smith, who had come to London to work for the Toronto Trust Society, and who lodged with a Mr and Mrs Callaghan at 27 Sun Street, Finsbury Square. Mr Callaghan became suspicious of Smith when he was heard saying that all prostitutes should be drowned. Smith also talked and moaned to himself, and kept three loaded revolvers hidden in a chest of drawers. Callaghan went to Winslow to express his suspicions, and he in turn contacted the police, who fully investigated his theory and showed it to be without foundation. Nevertheless, convinced that he was correct, for many years Winslow declared his theory at every chance, and claimed that his actions were responsible for forcing Jack the Ripper into abandoning murder and fleeing the country.
In his 1910 memoirs Winslow describes how he spent days and nights in Whitechapel: ""The detectives knew me, the lodging house keepers knew me, and at last the poor creatures of the streets came to know me. In terror they rushed to me with every scrap of information which might, to my mind, be of value to me. The frightened women looked for hope in my presence. They felt reassured and welcomed me to their dens and obeyed my commands eagerly, and I found the bits of information I wanted"".When Winslow's claims about knowing the identity of the Ripper were reported in the English press Scotland Yard sent Chief Inspector Donald Swanson to interview him. Confronted with this senior police officer, Forbes Winslow immediately began to back-pedal. He said the story printed in the newspaper was not accurate and misrepresented the entire conversation between himself and the reporter. He further stated that the reporter had tricked him into talking about the Ripper murders. In fact, Winslow had never given any information to the police with the exception of his earlier theory concerning an escaped lunatic, a theory which even Forbes Winslow abandoned.According to Donald McCormick, for a short period the police suspected Winslow of involvement in the killings because of his persistence and constant agitation in the Jack the Ripper case, and they checked on his movements at the time of the Ripper murders. He gained further publicity, and visited New York City in August 1895, to chair a meeting on lunacy at an International Medico-Legal Congress. He also appeared as an expert defence witness in some American cases involving lunacy.


== Spiritualism ==
Winslow was the author of the 1877 pamphlet Spiritualistic Madness which identified spiritualism as a cause of insanity. He wrote that many believers in spiritualism were women and victims of their own gullibility. Winslow wrote that most believers in spiritualism were insane and suffer from mental delusions. He affirmed that there were ""nearly ten thousand [such] persons in America"" who had been confined in lunatic asylums.


== Personal life ==

His older brother was the Revd Forbes Edward Winslow, the vicar of Epping, while his sister, Susanna Frances, married the humorist Arthur William à Beckett. Forbes Winslow published his memoirs, Recollections of Forty Years, in 1910, and also wrote the Handbook For Attendants on the Insane. He founded the British Hospital for Mental Disorders in London, and was a lecturer on insanity at Charing Cross Hospital and was a physician to the West End Hospital and the North London Hospital for Consumption. A member of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and a Vice-President of the Psycho—Therapeutic Society, he married twice. In the 1880s, he was the owner of the famous progenitor of the modern English Mastiff, Ch. Crown Prince.Winslow died at his home in Devonshire Street, London, of a heart attack, aged 69. He left a widow, three sons and a daughter, Dulcie Sylvia, who, in 1906, married Roland St John Braddell (1880–1966).
Winslow appears as the central figure in the 2003 novel A Handbook for Attendants on the Insane. It has now been republished in a revised new edition as The Revelation of Jack the Ripper by Alan Scarfe.

== History ==
The first-ever Shrum Bowl game was played on October 16, 1967, at Empire Stadium and it was also the first-ever football game to be played between the two schools. The UBC Thunderbirds played in the Canadian Intercollegiate Athletic Union (CIAU) while SFU played against American colleges until formally joining the American-based National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) in 1969, meaning that Shrum Bowls were played as exhibition games. In the first five years it was played, SFU typically dominated the games, posting a 4–0–1 record and outscoring UBC 168–32. While all games were played on neutral ground at Empire stadium, home to the BC Lions, the games were played with American rules when UBC was used to playing Canadian rules. Because of the heavily skewed losses, declining fan interest, and the CWUAA's objections to SFU granting aid to student athletes, the games were temporarily discontinued.The game was revived in 1978 after both schools issued a joint statement on October 27 of that year that the game would be played after the CIAU season with all proceeds going to the United Way of Canada and drew a record 14,600. Shrum Bowl VI was played at Empire Stadium and under Canadian rules for the first time, after UBC argued that since the game was to be played on Canadian soil, it should be played as such. With the Thunderbirds as national championship contenders and games being played under their rules, the Shrum Bowl became tilted in UBC's favour. UBC would win four of the next five games, including the 1982 game that was played following the program's first Vanier Cup victory. Despite the popularity of the games, which had 9000 fans witness the 1982 edition, the Shrum Bowl was again put on hiatus due to scheduling difficulties between the schools' respective leagues.On January 13, 1987, history repeated itself as UBC and SFU jointly announced that the Shrum Bowl would be revived with a five-year commitment from the CIAU. The agreement would see UBC having a bye-week on the second weekend of September for five years, ensuring that scheduling the game could be easily accomplished year-to-year. The 11th Shrum Bowl would be played at a team's home stadium for the first time in the game's history, at Swangard Stadium in Burnaby and once again under American rules. In 1985, Dr. Gordon Shrum died during the game's second hiatus, but his son spoke at the January press conference stating that nothing would have made his father happier than to have this game revived. UBC won the 1987 and 1988 games en route to their first ever lead in the series, 6–5–1, including a four-game winning streak, which has proved to be the longest in the history of the game. The games were now being played at alternating locations as the 1988 game was played at UBC's Thunderbird Stadium with 8,600 in attendance. The 1991 game drew the largest crowd of that era with an estimated 10,500 showing up to a temporarily expanded Swangard Stadium. 
The Shrum Bowl was played on the second weekend of September from 1987 to 1993 as was originally intended, but the game ran into problems in 1994. In 1993, UBC played two opponents in one week, which proved to be extremely strenuous on the players and coaches. Since the team was not prepared to do that again, the September 10, 1994 match-up was cancelled. The Shrum Bowl resumed play in 1995 under a new stipulation: every time UBC hosts, the game would be played under Canadian rules and every time SFU hosts, it would be played under American rules. While SFU opposed the new rule, since the game was their first of the season and had to practice with different rules, both schools were simply satisfied that the game was back.
The format of alternating venues and rules was kept until 2001, which would be SFU's last in the NAIA. In 2002, SFU made the switch to the Canadian Interuniversity Sport league (formerly CIAU), which meant that they would not only be playing Canadian rules, but they would also be in the same conference as UBC. This also meant that the Shrum Bowl would count for two points in the standings as opposed to being an exhibition game and the teams would be playing two games against each other each year instead of one. From 2002 to 2006, the Shrum Bowl was the first match-up of the season between the two teams while the second was typically played midweek following Thanksgiving. Since this was often strenuous on the teams having such short weeks, the CIS moved the other regular season match-up to the beginning of the season in 2007 with the Shrum Bowl becoming the second game played between UBC and SFU.The 2009 season marked the last game to be played while the two teams were both in the CIS. In 2010, SFU made the successful transfer to the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division II's Great Northwest Athletic Conference. Once again, the game would be played with alternating rules. The Shrum Bowl was played at Thunderbird Stadium in 2010, but could not be played in 2011 due to scheduling conflicts for both teams. SFU had no mid-season byes and UBC was reluctant to play at the beginning or end of the season.


== Attempted revivals ==


=== 2012 attempt ===
After 2011 resulted in no game being played between the two schools, representatives from both UBC and SFU had stated that they would make greater efforts to have a Shrum Bowl match played in 2012, but there was no result. Simon Fraser had no mid-season bye weeks, while UBC was reluctant to play at the end of their season because it would conflict with possible playoff games.UBC's director of athletics and recreation at the time, Bob Philip, suggested that the Thunderbirds could request to move a CIS game to their bye week in order to align their schedule with SFU's. He further acknowledged that SFU would have less bargaining power in the NCAA after having been full-time members for only two years. It was also suggested that the game could be played in January like American college bowl games, but the focus is on playing during the regular football season. While former SFU head coach Dave Johnson suggested that they could play in a non-conference game at the beginning of the season, (former) UBC head coach Shawn Olson was against the idea because it would be treated like a preseason game with many non-starters playing.


=== 2014, 2015 attempts ===
In the summer of 2014, an unofficial agreement on a framework that would have allowed the game to be played every season was reported on in The Province. UBC would require their Canada West schedule to begin the first weekend after Labour Day, allowing the Shrum Bowl to function as the season-opener for both teams over the Labour Day weekend.
“I would be very surprised that, if UBC has an opening on the Labour Day weekend, that we don’t play the game,” (now former) Simon Fraser athletic director Milt Richards told The Province. Looking ahead to 2015 Richards said, “I think we have an agreement in principle to play the game. We’ve agreed that if the stars align, we’re going to do this thing.”
With new head coaches Kelly Bates and Blake Nill, the opportunity for a 2016 Shrum Bowl seemed promising. However, scheduling challenges remained. For Simon Fraser to play a U Sports team, they would need to apply for a waiver from the NCAA to play for a special post-season bowl game. By doing so, SFU would relinquish participation in the D2 playoffs, should they qualify. The earliest UBC could play would be the first week of December, which is the week after Vanier Cup. Ultimately, a game was not scheduled.


=== 2020 Discussion ===
In the spring of 2020, there was reportedly renewed interest in reviving the Shrum Bowl game. The athletic directors for both universities, Kavie Toor of UBC and Theresa Hanson of SFU, were both in favour of reinstating the game to invigorate the student body and promote their athletics' brands. Initially, the discussion was for the 2020 season, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, both programs had their 2020 seasons cancelled. While the scheduling restrictions remain, the cancellation of league games had generated the renewed interest in scheduling another Shrum Bowl game in the future.

The township was located on the eastern lower slopes of Mount Jukes, below the West Coast Range, and on the southern bank of the King River.  The locality had had a former name of King River


== Townsite ==
The town reserve was gazetted on 5 June 1900. The town survey was completed in November 1900.  By 1902 there had been development of over 150 dwellings, and 700 people living in the town. The last residents to move away left in 1928.
In photographs found in Geoffrey Blainey's The Peaks of Lyell, the foreground shows a bridge, the Baxter River bridge.  This was a crucial connection for people travelling between the railway stopping places.


== Smelters failure ==
At the turn of the twentieth century, the township had had a smelter and railway connection with the North Mount Lyell mine.
The North Mount Lyell smelters failed, despite attempts in 1901 and 1902 to correct issues.The company was absorbed by the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company in 1903.The townsite soon lost population after the failure of smelter operations.  The North Mount Lyell Railway which serviced Crotty's connections with Gormanston, Linda and Pillinger (Kelly Basin) remained in service for a couple of decades before closing.Most historical photos of Crotty show the smelters, the hotels, and the very small houses/huts. The most iconic photograph is that found in Geoffrey Blainey's The Peaks of Lyell, dated 1902, which was taken from the embankment just east of the railway line, looking west, up the main street with the smoke from the smelter in the air, and Mount Jukes in the background.


== Hydro dam era ==
During the late 1970s and at an early stage in the ""No Dams"" campaign to stop the establishment of a dam on the Franklin River, a small group of musicians in Queenstown formed a group called the 'Crotty Ditty Band'.During the building of the King power development in the 1980s, the Hydro Crotty Camp was home to several hundred dam construction workersIn the 1990s the townsite was inundated by Lake Burbury after Crotty Dam was installed as a part of the King River Power development scheme. Despite this, the Tasmanian 1:25000 Owen map still identifies the Proclaimed Town of Crotty. During 2016, Lake Burbury receded to a historically low level and remains of the town became visible.
On the eastern shores of Lake Burbury, the land south of the Lyell Highway, and adjacent to the Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park, is known as the Crotty Conservation Area. This has an area of 44.2 square kilometres (17.1 sq mi) and was established on 27 December 2000.

As a music critic, he was known for his straightforward style of critique that often used colorful language and original metaphors to either praise or lambaste musicians whom Seigal liked or disliked.


== Early life and education ==
Born in Syracuse, New York, Seigal moved to San Diego in 1973 and played in several unknown bands while working as a clerk at a record store and attending community college. In 1979, he joined the Grossmont College student newspaper as a writer and was later promoted to editor.


== Career ==


=== Music ===
In 1981, Seigal, a singer and guitarist, formed the rockabilly band, the Rockin' Roulettes.
In 1983, he quit the Roulettes after he was invited to join the Beat Farmers with Jerry Raney and Country Dick Montana. He took musician Rolle Love with him. The Beat Farmers eventually signed with Rhino records and became known regionally and nationally with their performances of songs such as ""Happy Boy"", ""Riverside"" and ""Gun Sale at the Church"".
Seigal left the Beat Farmers in 1986 to start a new band, The Jacks. A year later, he was hired as a music critic for the San Diego Reader. He would later be fired from the paper when his editors suggested he write negative reviews about local musicians whom Seigal felt did not deserve bad press.
Recording as Buddy Blue, Seigal began performing again in 1991. He released the CD Guttersnipes and Zealots in 1991, which included vocals from Southern California rockers Dave Alvin and Mojo Nixon, it featured the songs, ""Duke of J Street,"" ""Someone You Knew,"" and ""Gun Sale at the Church."" The albums Dive Bar Casanovas, Greasy Jazz, Dipsomania, Pretend It's Okay (which included a guest spot from Chris Gaffney), and Sordid Lives followed. All were recorded by either Buddy Blue or the Buddy Blue Band.
Throughout his musical career, Seigal performed jump blues, a form of jazzy blues focused on uptempo rhythms and loud, boisterous vocals.
Seigal's impact on the San Diego music scene was diverse. As a critic, he promoted those who he thought were worthy and viciously degraded musicians who he perceived as faking it or contrived. As a musician, he proliferated different styles of jazz and blues and periods in his bands often gave performers a crash course in tight songs and sets and exposed them to myriad musical styles and canvasses. Shortly before his death, Seigal reunited with Jerry Raney and Rolle Love of the Beat Farmers, along with drummer Joel 'Bongo' Kmak as 'The Flying Putos' at local venues, but started using 'The Farmers' when they decided to record an album together (circa 2005). (Country Dick Montana died onstage of a heart attack in 1995) playing shows as The Farmers. He had previously played in Raney-Blue (circa 1996) but left when the band became Powerthud.


=== Writing ===
Seigal was a champion of underground comics from the 1960s and 1970s, writing about them for the Los Angeles Times and other newspapers.By 1990, Seigal's irreverent style of writing led him to writing assignments with a variety of Southern California newspapers, including The San Diego Union-Tribune, Los Angeles Times, The Orange County Weekly, San Jose Mercury News and a full-time writing position with the weekly La Jolla Light At the time of Seigal's death, he had been writing for several years for the OC Weekly alternative paper.
In March 2002, The Union-Tribune issued a memo to its staff stating that one of Seigal's articles, which had run in the paper, used words like ""old fart"", ""love turnips"", ""rat bastids"", ""crapola"" and ""pooh-butts"" that were deemed unsuitable for readers. Seigal was known as the 'Lovable Curmudgeon' during his days writing weekly articles called “Blue Notes” that ran each Thursday in the Night & Day section in the Thursday edition of the San Diego Union-Tribune.


== Death ==
Seigal died of a heart attack on an early Sunday morning April 2, 2006 at age 48. Siegal's last performance was with Jerry Raney at a favorite watering hole in La Mesa, California called 'The Parkway Bar' on March 25, 2006.In January 2012, the Buddy Blue Reunion Band, which included all of the original members, played at the Belly Up venue in San Diego in remembrance of Seigal.

The area of Bosnia comprises approximately 51,200 km2, and makes up about 80% of the territory of the present-day state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. There are no true borders between the region of Bosnia and the region of Herzegovina. Unofficially, Herzegovina is south of the mountain Ivan planina. According to another unofficial definition, Herzegovina encompasses the watersheds of the Neretva and Trebišnjica rivers.


== History ==

The Central part of Bosnia was inhabited by Neolithic farmers that belonged to the Kakanj culture, and later replaced by another neolithic culture called the Butmir culture. The first Indo-Europeans are thought to be members of eneolithic Vučedol culture.In the Bronze Age  the area is thought to have been inhabited by Iron Age Central Bosnian cultural group and Glasinac culture. Later on the Illyrian tribe of the Daesitiates would become dominant in these area.The historical records of the region are scarce until its first recorded standalone (domestic) ruler and viceroy of Bosnian state, Ban Borić, was appointed in 1154.
De Administrando Imperio describes a small župa of Bosona (Greek: χωρίον Βόσονα) that was located around the river Bosna in the modern-day fields of Sarajevo and of Visoko.Under its first known by name ruler, Stephen, Duke of Bosnia, in the 1080s, the region spanned the upper course of the rivers Bosna, the Vrbas and the Neretva.

At the end of the 14th century, under Tvrtko I of Bosnia, the Bosnian kingdom included most of the territory of today's Bosnia and of what would later become known as Herzegovina.
The kingdom lost its independence to the Ottoman Empire in 1463. The region of Bosnia's westernmost city at the time of the conquest was Jajce.The Ottoman Empire initially expanded into Bosnia and Herzegovina through a territory called the Bosansko Krajište. It was transformed into the Sanjak of Bosnia and the Sanjak of Herzegovina after 1462/1463. The first Ottoman administration called Eyalet of Bosnia was finally formed in 1527, after long armed resistance to the north and to the west by Counts Franjo and Ivaniš Berislavić of the noble house of Berislavići Grabarski.
Eventually, following the Great Turkish War, in the 18th century the Eyalet came to encompass the area largely matching that of today's Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In 1833, the Eyalet of Herzegovina was temporarily split off under Ali-paša Rizvanbegović. The area acquired the name of ""Bosnia and Herzegovina"" in 1853 as a result of a twist in political events following his death. After the 1864 administrative reform, the province was named Vilayet of Bosnia. Austria-Hungary occupied the whole country in 1878. It remained formally part of the Ottoman Empire under the title of Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina until 1908, when Austria-Hungary provoked the Bosnian crisis by formally annexing the province.


== Regional identity ==
Within Bosnia and Herzegovina, the region of Bosnia has a traditional regional identity, distinctive from the regional identity of the neighboring Herzegovina. Bosnian regional identity was attested as early as the 10th century, when Constantin VII Porphyrogenetos referred to Bosnia as a particular region. Development of Bosnia's regional identity continued throughout the Middle Ages, and it was also acknowledged in the 15th century by the Ottoman conquerors, who created the Sanjak of Bosnia in 1463, giving it a regional name, which was not always the case. By the end of the Ottoman rule (1878), regional Bosnianhood became a distinctive mark of local identity, that transcended traditional ethnic and religious distinctions within the general population of Bosnia, and the same notion of regional Bosniandom was preserved throughout the periods of Austro-Hungarian (1878-1918) and Yugoslav (1918-1992) rule.

It is a member of the family Ranidae, or true frogs.","The moor frog (Rana arvalis) is a slim, reddish-brown, semiaquatic amphibian native to Europe and Asia. It is a member of the family Ranidae, or true frogs.


== Taxonomy ==
The family the moor frog belongs to, Ranidae, is a broad group containing 605 species. The family is like a “catch-all” for ranoid frogs that do not belong to any other families. Since this is the case, the characteristics that define them are more general, and the frogs are found all throughout the world, on every continent but Antarctica.
The moor frog's genus, Rana, is a little more specific. Frogs of this genus are found in Europe, Asia, South America, and North America. The moor frog is not found in either of the Americas, unlike the foothill yellow-legged frog, Cascades frog, and Columbia spotted frog, which are all found in North America.
The moor frog's scientific name, Rana arvalis means ""frog of the fields"". It is also called the Altai brown frog because frogs from the Altai Mountains in Asia have been included in the R. arvalis species. The Altai frogs have some different characteristics such as shorter shins, but currently there is no official distinction and all frogs are placed under Rana arvalis. The taxonomy may be more defined in the future.


== Description ==
This is a small bog frog, characterized by an unspotted belly, a large, dark ear spot, and — often, not always — a pale stripe down the center of the back. They are generally described as a reddish-brown, but can also be yellow, gray, or light olive. Their bellies are white or yellow and they have a ""bandit-like"" black stripe going from their nose to their ears. They vary from 5.5 to 6.0 cm long, but can reach up to 7.0 cm in length, and their heads are more tapered than those of the Common frog (Rana temporaria). The skin on their flanks and thighs is smooth, and the posterior part of their tongues is forked and free. They have horizontal pupils, their feet are partially webbed, and their back legs are shorter than those of other species of frogs.  The males are different from the females because of the nuptial pads on their first fingers and their paired guttural vocal sacs.


== Distribution and habitat ==
The species has an extensive distribution across Europe. It can be found inhabiting an area stretching from the lowlands of Central and Southern Europe to Siberia, in Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, and Ukraine. However, they are believed to be extirpated in Switzerland and possibly in Serbia as well; the records of frogs being in Serbia at all may have been in error. Alsace, France, constitutes the western boundary of their territory. Moor frogs were also confirmed to have been present in East Anglia in the UK, after archaeological remains were found from the 9th century. Furthermore, a historical reference was also found from the 13th century by Bartholomeus Anglicus (""Rana palustres""). The species has been successfully bred in captivity in the UK and a reintroduction has been proposed as part of Celtic Reptile & Amphibian's rewilding plans.The types of land they can inhabit are greatly varied. They live in tundra, forest tundra, forest, forest steppe, and steppe, forest edges and glades, semideserts, swamps, meadows, fields, bush lands, and gardens. They prefer areas untouched by humans, such as damp meadows and bogs, but they still may be able to live in agricultural and urban areas.Moor frogs provide a good model for studying local adaptation as they experience a wide range of environments and are relatively limited in their movements. Their restriction in movements implies limited gene flow and facilitates evolution through adaptive genetic differentiation among populations.

Moor frogs will hibernate sometime between September and June, depending on the latitude of the location. Frogs in southwestern, plains areas will disappear later (around November or December) and return earlier (February). Frogs in cold, polar areas, though, will disappear sooner (in September) and return later (in June).


=== Breeding ===
The mating season takes place between March and June right after the end of hibernation. Males form breeding choruses, and their songs sound similar to those of the agile frog, (Rana dalmatina). Their calls can ""sound like air escaping from a submerged empty bottle: 'waug...waug...waug'. Males can also develop bright-blue coloration for a few days during the season.The spawning happens very quickly and is completed in three to 28 days. The spawn of each frog is laid in one or two clusters of 500-3000 eggs in warm, shallow waters like in ponds.


=== Metamorphosis ===
Metamorphosis happens between June and October. Larvae are about 45 mm long and colored dark with small metallic dots. When they become tadpoles, they eat algae and small invertebrates. The adult frogs' feeding is halted during the breeding season, but their diets consist of insects and various invertebrates.


=== Effects of acidification on population ===


==== Environmental plasticity ====
Increased acidity levels in breeding areas may be problematic for moor frog populations, as it reduces survival and growth of the aquatic embryos and larvae. When exposed to acidity, moor frogs were however shown to be able to adapt relatively rapidly (within 16–40 generations). Local adaptation to acidity is also possible in survival during the embryonic stage, during which frogs are most sensitive to severe acidity. Moreover, compared to those from neutral sites, acid origin populations have higher embryonic and larval acid tolerance (survival and larval period were less negatively affected by low pH), higher larval growth but slower larval development rates, and larger metamorphosing size. Divergence in embryonic acid tolerance and metamorphic size correlates most strongly with breeding pond pH, whereas divergence in larval period and larval growth correlates most strongly with latitude and predator density, respectively.


==== Maternal effects ====
For female moor frogs, in order to optimize their maternal investments, they need to balance between their own fitness and the fitness of their offspring. Additionally, under the great pressure exerted by acidification, female moor frogs also need to do a trade-off between quality and quantity of the offspring.Environmental stress, like acidity, may either select for or select against certain phenotypes and hence may increase variation in fitness. The adaptive optima for the population would shift greatly compared to those living in less acidic and more benign environments, thereby making the allocation of resources even more important. As a result of the increasing variation in fitness, frogs from acidic environments may also favor different reproductive strategies than those more benign environments. Compared to neutral origin females, acid origin females tend to invest relatively more in fecundity than in egg size, invest more in their offspring than in self-maintenance, and increase their reproductive effort as their residual reproductive value decreases. Consequently, acid origin females increase the clutch size and total reproductive output with age, while neutral origin females only increase egg size but not clutch size or total reproductive output with age.In conclusion, environmental acidification lowers maternal investment, selects for investment in larger eggs at a cost to fecundity, imposes negative effects on reproductive output, and alters the relationship between female phenotype and maternal investment, as well as strengthens the egg-size-fecundity trade-off.


== Population threats ==
This species is generally common and often abundant. It faces few major threats and is currently classified as Least Concern by the IUCN. The moor frog may be impacted by the destruction and pollution of breeding sites and adjacent habitats, mostly through urbanization, recreational use of waterside areas, and intensive agriculture. The species does not appear to be notably susceptible to chytridiomycosis, although the fungus has been detected in frogs in Germany.

== Project description ==
The Rodenbach sculpture trail is part of the hiking trail network of the collective municipality of Weilerbach. It begins at Dorfweiher and runs along the nature reserve to the old Steige (climbing trail). Along the path there are 19 sculptures or groups of sculptures.


=== History ===
In 1991, the municipality of Rodenbach invited schoolgirls from the stone sculpturing class of the German ""master school"" (Meisterschule) in Kaiserslautern to create a sculpture trail in Rodenbach. Head teachers, departmental schoolteachers and sponsors helped to realise the project. As a theme for the works, motives related to the local area were chosen: water or Celtic history.
In 2003, the sculptor, Ludwig Grub, who had lived in Rodenbach for many years, created the Summstein (""humming rock""), (Sculpture Way, Pos. 2) and the Rodenbacher Tümpelkriecher (""Rodenbach puddle creeper"") on the village pond, (Sculpture Way, Pos. 3); as well as the well in Rathausstraße for which old cattle troughs were used.

== Life ==
Born in Munich, Kern studied with the famous coloratura soprano Hermine Bosetti (1875–1936). The pupil followed the path and roles of her teacher - both at the opera houses of Munich and Vienna and as Ännchen and Zerbinetta.
She made her debut as early as 1924 at the Bavarian State Opera in Munich as Olympia in The Tales of Hoffmann. There are different indications about the duration of her engagement in Munich. She was the first coloratura soprano to move to the Städtische Opernhaus in Frankfurt, where she had a contract until 1928. There, the ambitious conductor Clemens Krauss was artistic director from 1924 to 1929, and Lothar Wallerstein acted as principal conductor. The two created a new, production-oriented musical theatre in Frankfurt and took care of the musical and dramatic development of the young singer. Kern was to be regarded as a Clemens Krauss singer for many years (and she later worked at the state operas of Vienna, Berlin and Munich during his time as director). In Frankfurt she was already able to acquire numerous roles of her later very extensive role repertoire. In February 1926 she was also involved in the premiere of an opera by Bernhard Sekles.
In 1927, she undertook a major South American tour. as well as in ten performances of Marcelline in Fidelio, embodied 38 times Adele in Die Fledermaus, sang - besides Zerbinetta - 5 times Fiakermilli, 6 times one of the maids in Elektra and 40 times Sophie in Der Rosenkavalier.
From 1928, she had her greatest success in Vienna as the maid Yvonne in 19 performances of Krenek's so-called jazz opera Jonny spielt auf, which was later banned by Nazi Germany as degenerate music, and in 1930 as Angelina in Rossini's La Cenerentola with Koloman von Pataky as her partner. She sang this role 25 times in Vienna. However, she also distinguished herself as a Verdi singer - 18 times Gilda, 16 times Oscar - and in the late romantic-veristic subject - 17 times Lucieta in Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari's I quatro rusteghi and 19 times Nuri in d'Albert's Tiefland. She could also be seen and heard in the State Opera in operettas by Heuberger, Lehár and Millöcker.
Kern sang in Vienna in three premieres: 1930 in Das Veilchen von Montmartre by Emmerich Kálmán at the Johann Strauß-Theater in 1930 in Endlich allein by Franz Lehár at the Theater an der Wien and 1934 in Fanny in Bittner's Das Veilchen at the Vienna State Opera. This performance was conducted by Clemens Krauss, who had taken over the direction of the Staatsoper in 1929, and staged by Lothar Wallerstein, who had accompanied Krauss from Frankfurt to Vienna. However, Wallerstein had to emigrate in 1938 due to Nazi racial laws and finally continued his career at the New York Metropolitan Opera.


=== Salzburg Festival ===
On 6 August 1927 her debut at the Salzburg Festival followed, under the musical direction of Robert Heger, as Susanna in The Marriage of Figaro. Furthermore she took over the roles of Marzelline and Zerlina in the reprises of Fidelio and Don Giovanni.
In 1929 she returned to Salzburg - as Zerlina and Sophie - and was then engaged by the Salzburg Festival until 1935. Don Giovanni was conducted by the outgoing Vienna State Opera Director Franz Schalk, the Rosenkavalier his successor and her mentor from Frankfurt, Clemens Krauss. In the following years Kern again sang Zerlina (1930), Susanna and Sophie (both 1930-35) in Salzburg, as well as Despina in Così fan tutte for the first time (1931 to 1934|1931-32 and 1934-35). She also appeared there as a concert singer.
Parallel to her engagements in Vienna and Salzburg, she developed a lively guest performance activity. In 1929 and 1931 she took part in two exemplary Max Reinhardt productions in Berlin: as Adele in the Fledermaus (at the Deutsches Theater) and as Olympia in The Tales of Hoffmann (at the Großes Schauspielhaus). In 1931 and 1933 she was a guest at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden in London, where her Sophie was especially admired in the Rosenkavalier. In 1933 she took over the role of Hannerl Krüger in Voices of Spring, a feature film by Pál Fejös. At the Berlin Theater des Westens in December of the same year she took part in the premiere of Eduard Künneke's Singspiel Die lockende Flamme. She gave guest performances at the Milan Scala and at the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma, in Paris, Venice and Rio de Janeiro. She also undertook a successful tour of Egypt.


=== Berlin and Munich ===
Like Julius Patzak and Viorica Ursuleac, Kern followed the conductor and director Clemens Krauss first to the Staatsoper Unter den Linden in Berlin in 1935 and then to the Bayerische Staatsoper in Munich in 1937. There, in her hometown, the artist achieved extraordinary popularity due to her razor-sharp coloratura, the silvery tone of her voice and the unusual brilliance of her performance. In Munich, Kern also sang her signature roles in operas by Mozart and Richard Strauss, including Sophie and Zerbinetta.
The singer's involvement in NS cultural policy is not known. In July 1944, however, she gave a guest performance as Zerbinetta in Krakow in a new production of Ariadne auf Naxos ordered by Governor General Hans Frank.At the age of 46 she had to retire from the stage because of a heart condition. She died in 1980 and was buried at Ostfriedhof in Munich.

The drafters and supporters of this bill are the National Commission on Violence against Women (Komisi Nasional Anti Kekerasan terhadap Perempuan, Komnas Perempuan) and the Service Provider Forum (Forum Pengada Layanan, FPL). The Chairperson of Komnas Perempuan, Azriana, said on September 7, 2015 that there were at least 15 kinds of sexual violence experienced by women in Indonesia, namely acts of rape, intimidation of sexual nuances (including rape threats or attempts), sexual harassment, sexual exploitation, forced marriage, forced pregnancy, forced abortion, forced contraception/sterilization, sexual torture, sexual punishment, and sexual control, including discriminatory rules based on morality and religion. 13 of them have not been regulated by law.This bill was proposed on January 26, 2016. Komnas Perempuan submitted the academic text of the PKS bill to the Indonesian People's Representative Council (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat, DPR) on May 13, 2016. The bill was included in the 2016 Priority Prolegnas (Program Legislasi Nasional, National Legislation Program) on June 6, 2016. This bill was withdrawn from the 2020 Priority Prolegnas on July 2, 2020. This withdrawal proposal was previously submitted by Commission VIII. Deputy Chairperson of Commission VIII Marwan Dasopang said it was difficult to discuss the bill at this time because of the clash on the definition of sexual violence and the rules of punishment. According to a member of Commission VIII from the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) faction Diah Pitaloka, the decision to remove this bill from the Prolegnas was not a statement from Commission VIII, because there was no meeting to decide that, and it was Marwan Dasopang's personal statement. According to Diah, even though it was removed from the 2020 Prolegnas, the PKS Bill will enter the 2021 Prolegnas which will be discussed by the Legislation Body of the People's Representative Council (Badan Legislasi Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat, Baleg).


== Contents ==
The PKS Bill does not only regulate procedural law and criminal sanctions regarding sexual violence, but rather regulates benefits for victims of sexual violence. According to the Director of the Legal Aid Institute (Lembaga Bantuan Hukum, LBH) APIK, Veny Octarini Siregar, the PKS Bill covers everything from prevention, fulfillment of victims' rights, recovery of victims to regulating handling during the legal process. The PKS Bill is considered to be a special law or lex specialis. The justice system will be made like juvenile justice. Victims can choose to meet or not meet with the perpetrators, and victims are placed in a special room during the trial. This bill also regulates the role of the community, such as actions taken by Rukun Tetangga or Rukun Warga. This bill charges the perpetrator to pay restitution not as compensation to the victim, but to bear the costs of the victim's recovery. There are nine forms of sexual violence described in this bill, namely sexual harassment, sexual exploitation, forced contraception, forced abortion, rape, forced marriage, forced prostitution, sexual slavery and sexual torture.


== Reactions ==
Chairman of the Indonesian Feminist Lawyer Clubs (IFLC) Nur Setia Alam Prawiranegara said the discussion of this bill was hampered ""because this bill does not generate a lot of money. It is different from the election bill, which may have a clear circulation of money."" In addition, Member of the People's Representative Council Commission VIII Rahayu Saraswati Djojohadikusumo admitted that there was no agreement on the PKS Bill between legislators and PKS Bill supporters. According to Saras, some parties consider the PKS Bill to be a regulation that justifies the existence of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT), and some think that this bill comes from foreign interests, even though the drafters and supporters of this bill are Komnas Perempuan and FPL. who are assisting victims of violence in Indonesia.A petition on Change.org urging the DPR and government to discuss the PKS Bill was signed by more than 50,000 netizens on May 6, 2016. On December 8, 2018, people from various alliances held a grand parade demanding that the government immediately pass the PKS Bill. The hashtag #sahkanruupks (Sign the PKS Bill) has become the most popular post on Twitter. The editor-in-chief of Jurnal Perempuan, Anita Dhewy, thinks that the ratification of the PKS Bill is urgent, especially after victims of sexual harassment in Indonesia have the courage to speak up after the emergence of the Me Too movement. Marwan Dasopang said that there were still many things that the DPR had to consider, such as interrogations that had to be coordinated with the police, the use of the title ""Elimination of Sexual Violence"" which could lead to various interpretations, the use of the word sexual desire which could be interpreted as same-sex desire. According to him, the existing regulations are sufficient to deal with acts of sexual violence.In a series of demonstrations and riots that took place in Indonesia in September 2019 by Indonesian students and journalists, one of the demonstrators' demands was to immediately pass the PKS Bill. During the Indonesia omnibus bill protests in July 2020, protesters also demanded the passing of PKS Bill.

The paper covers community events, sports and local news. The Sun is the newspaper of record for Sunnyside.


== History ==
The Sunnyside Sun was founded in 1901 by William Hitchcock, a member of a group of Dunkards who were migrating from South Dakota in search of a site for a Christian Cooperative Colony. They purchased the townsite in 1900 and soon founded the Sun, along with various other institutions. It was a weekly paper. That same year, it was identified as one of four Washington papers that refused to publish advertisements for saloons.In 1914, Yancey Freeman of the Sun was elected vice president of the Yakima-Benton-Kittitas Press Association, an organization newly formed to obtain uniform advertising rates in the Yakima valley. A. S. Hillyer of the Sun was the first speaker featured at the annual convention of the Washington State Press Association in 1922. Also in 1922, the Sun joined with other Washington newspapers, including the Grandview Herald, Ellensburg Record, Wapato Independent. Toppenish Review, Toppenish Tribune. Kennewick Courier-Reporter, Zillah Mirror, Richland Advocate, and Prosser Record-Bulletin to advocate for the McNary-Smith Reclamation Bill. The newspapers' testimony was entered into the Congressional Record of the 67th Congress.In his History of the Yakima Valley (1919), William Denison Lyman described the Sun as ""one of the strongest weekly papers in the valley."" The book identified William Hitchcock as the founder and longtime proprietor, and stated that in 1909 the management changed. Hillyer was the editor and manager as of that date. The newspaper's contents were used as a basis for comparing the relative wealth and population of towns in its part of the Yakima Valley.Hillyer joined with leaders of other Yakima Valley news organizations in 1948 to develop an educational program for students in the local 4-H Club to learn about the news business. The event was intended to be repeated annually.As of 1959, the paper had an audited circulation of 1,288.The Sun absorbed the weekly Sunnyside Times in 1962. The paper was acquired by the Oregon-based Eagle Newspapers in 1984. Eagles bought the competing Daily News as well, and merged the two in 1986, under the title Daily Sun.Daily publication began with Vol.1 in 1986 and ceased with Vol. 117 in 2018. In 1986, Tom Lanctot publisher of Sunnyside Sun and the Eagles executives merged Daily News into Daily Sun Newspaper. After the sale in 2018 the name became Sunnyside Sun which is still in circulation today.The newspapers original name Sunnyside Sun was changed to Daily Sun News in 1986. In 2018 the name became Sunnyside Sun again.


== Achievements ==
In 2002, the Daily Sun News collaborated with Sunnyside Museum to produce a commemorative book, A Pictorial History of Sunnyside Washington. The book features historic photos of Sunnyside.
In 2011, a design specialist and photographer of Daily Sun News won seven awards between them from the Washington Better Newspaper Contest hosted by Washington Newspaper Publishers Association.

On July 28, she competed at the 2018 U.S. Classic where she won the silver medal in the all-around and on balance beam, behind Simone Biles on both. She also won the gold medal on bars, one tenth of a point ahead of Alyona Shchennikova, and she placed fourth on floor behind Biles, Jade Carey, and Morgan Hurd.In August at the 2018 U.S. National Championships, McCusker won the bronze medal in the all-around behind Biles and Morgan Hurd. She also won the silver medal on bars behind Biles, the bronze medal on beam behind Biles and Kara Eaker, and she placed seventh on floor. In October, McCusker participated in the World Team Selection Camp. She placed first on bars, second in the all-around behind Biles, second on beam behind Eaker, third on floor behind Biles and Grace McCallum, and seventh on vault. The following day, she was named to the 2018 World team alongside Biles, Hurd, McCallum, Eaker, and alternate Ragan Smith.During the qualification round at the 2018 World Championships, McCusker placed eighth in the all-around after falling off beam and having a sub-par bars performance. She did not qualify to the All-Around Final due to teammates Biles and Hurd placing higher than her. During the Team Final, McCusker competed on bars and beam. She rebounded from her troubles in the qualification round to contribute scores of 14.500 on bars and 13.733 on beam towards the U.S. team's total. Her bars score was the second highest of the day behind Biles and tied with two-time Olympic bars champion Aliya Mustafina. The U.S. won the gold medal with a score of 171.629, 8.766 points ahead of second place Russia, beating previous margin of victory records set in the open-ended code of points era at the 2014 World Championships (6.693) and the 2016 Olympic Games (8.209).


=== 2019 ===
In February, USA Gymnastics announced that McCusker was selected to compete at the Birmingham World Cup in March.  There, she won the silver medal in the all-around behind Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina after counting falls on vault and beam. She recorded the highest scores on bars and floor.In June, after the conclusion of the American Classic, McCusker was named as one of the eight athletes being considered for the team that would compete at the 2019 Pan American Games, along with Sloane Blakely, Kara Eaker, Aleah Finnegan, Morgan Hurd, Shilese Jones, Sunisa Lee, and Leanne Wong.In July at the 2019 U.S. Classic, McCusker won the silver medal in the all-around behind Simone Biles with a score of 57.900. In addition, she won the bronze medal on bars behind Hurd and Lee, the silver medal on beam behind Eaker, and she placed fifth on floor behind Biles, Jade Carey, Grace McCallum, and Eaker. After the competition, she was officially named to the 2019 Pan American Games team alongside Eaker, Finnegan, Hurd, and Wong.At the 2019 Pan American Games, Riley competed on all four events during the team final/qualification round. She contributed scores on bars, beam, and floor to the U.S. team's gold medal winning performance. She qualified to the all-around final in first place with a total of 57.050, just over three tenths ahead of Eaker. Additionally, she also qualified to the uneven bars and floor exercise finals in first place and the balance beam final in second place behind Eaker. During the all-around final, McCusker won the silver medal behind Ellie Black of Canada after she fell off bars while performing her Ricna. On the first day of event finals, McCusker rebounded from her fall in the all-around to win the gold medal on bars ahead of Wong and Black. On the second day of event finals, McCusker won the bronze medal on beam behind Eaker and Black after she fell on her dismount, and she placed fifth on floor after going out of bounds twice.At the 2019 U.S. National Championships, McCusker competed on all four events on the first day of competition and was in second place on balance beam behind Biles and in fourth place in the all-around behind Biles, Sunisa Lee, and Jade Carey after falling off the uneven bars. On the second day of competition, she competed on vault and uneven bars before her coach decided to pull her from the remaining two events due to McCusker feeling sick to her stomach. She ended up placing seventh on uneven bars, tied with Jordan Chiles. She was added to the national team for the fourth time.McCusker was one of fifteen gymnasts invited to worlds selection camp and was a frontrunner to make the team. However, one day before the first day of camp, it was announced she had withdrawn from contention due to a case of “mild rhabdomyolysis”.In November McCusker signed her National Letter of Intent with the Florida Gators, starting in the 2020–21 school year.


=== 2020 ===
In February McCusker's coach Maggie Haney was suspended pending the outcome of a hearing into alleged abuse.  As a result McCusker announced on Instagram that she would finish her elite career training at Arizona Sunrays alongside fellow national team member Jade Carey.  It was later revealed that McCusker testified against Haney via a letter read at the hearing, with their relationship starting to worsen after McCusker's loss to Aliya Mustafina at the 2019 Birmingham World Cup.In May McCusker announced that she will defer attending the University of Florida until after the Olympic Games, which were postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, starting in the 2021–22 school year.In November news broke that McCusker had sued her former coaches, Maggie Haney and Victoria Levine, for negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and assault.  McCusker cited how Haney forced her to train with an injured wrist in April 2017, an injured hamstring and a fractured ischium in the months leading up to the 2017 World Championships, foot fractures in early 2018, a torn supraspinous ligament in early 2019, and forced McCusker to train and compete at the 2019 U.S. Classic and 2019 Pan American Games while being diagnosed with exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis.


=== 2021 ===
McCusker returned to gymnastics at the 2021 Winter Cup, marking her first competition since switching gyms to Arizona Sunrays. She competed every event but floor exercise, finishing second on bars behind reigning national champion on the event, Sunisa Lee.  The following month at a National Team camp McCusker was named to the National Team for the fifth time.  In May McCusker competed at the U.S. Classic.  She got injured during the first rotation after a bad landing on vault and withdrew from the rest of the competition.  At the National Championships McCusker only competed on uneven bars.  She finished second behind Sunisa Lee, achieving the top score on the apparatus on day 2 of the competition.  As a result she was added to the national team and selected to compete at the upcoming Olympic Trials.  At the Olympic Trials McCusker finished fourth on uneven bars after falling off the apparatus on day two of the competition; she was not added to the Olympic team.


== NCAA career ==


=== 2021–2022 season ===
McCusker made her NCAA debut on January 7 in a quad meet against Rutgers, Northern Illinois, and Texas Women's.  She only competed on the uneven bars where she scored a 9.825 to help Florida win the meet.

== Plot ==
The musical's story spans about 40 years, from the late 1880s to the late 1920s. Magnolia Hawks (Irene Dunne) is an 18-year-old on her family's show boat, the Cotton Blossom, which travels the Mississippi River putting on shows. She meets Gaylord Ravenal (Allan Jones), a charming gambler, falls in love with him, and eventually marries him. Together with their baby daughter, the couple leaves the boat and moves to Chicago, where they live off Gaylord's gambling winnings. After about 10 years, he experiences an especially bad losing streak and leaves Magnolia, out of a sense of guilt that he is ruining her life because of his losses. Magnolia is forced to bring up her young daughter alone. In a parallel plot, Julie LaVerne (Helen Morgan) (the show boat's leading actress, who is part black, but passing as white) is forced to leave the boat because of her background, taking Steve Baker (Donald Cook) (her white husband, to whom, under the state's law, she is illegally married) with her. Julie is eventually also abandoned by her husband, and she becomes an alcoholic. Magnolia becomes a success on the stage in Chicago. Twenty-three years later, Magnolia and Ravenal are reunited at the theater in which Kim, their daughter, is appearing in her first Broadway starring role.

== Production history ==
This film version of Show Boat stars Irene Dunne as Magnolia and Allan Jones as Ravenal, with Charles Winninger, Paul Robeson, Helen Morgan, Helen Westley, Queenie Smith, Sammy White, Donald Cook, Hattie McDaniel, Charles Middleton, and Arthur Hohl. It was directed by James Whale, who tried to bring as many people from the stage production as he could to work on the film. (Florenz Ziegfeld, who died in 1932, had originally produced Show Boat onstage.) Winninger, Morgan and White had all previously played their roles in both the original 1927 stage production and the 1932 stage revival of the musical. Robeson, for whom the role of Joe was actually written, had appeared in the show onstage in London in 1928 and in the Broadway revival of 1932. Dunne had been brought in to replace Norma Terris, the original Magnolia, in the touring version of the show, and had toured the U.S. in the role beginning in 1929. Francis X. Mahoney, who played the brief role of the comic stagehand ""Rubber Face"" Smith, had also starred in the original production and in the 1932 Broadway revival, and would repeat his role in the 1946 Broadway revival of Show Boat, two years before his death.
This film also enlisted the services of the show's original orchestrator, Robert Russell Bennett, and its original conductor, Victor Baravalle, as the film's music director and conductor. The screenplay for the film was written by Hammerstein.
The songs were performed in a manner very similar to the original stage version, not counting the three new songs written for the film. Many of the show's original vocal arrangements (by an uncredited Will Vodery) were retained in the film. ""Why Do I Love You?"" had been filmed in a new setting—inside a running open-top automobile—but was cut just before the film's release to tighten the running time. It is featured in all stage presentations of Show Boat, and if performed in its entirety is a long song, running six minutes and forty seconds. There is no word on whether or not the film footage has survived, but modern sources state that the visibly jerky car ride did not match the studio recording well enough, and the song was dropped, but a hint of it remains underneath the dialog. The music of the song is heard in the automobile sequence, in an earlier hotel lobby scene, and in the scene in which Magnolia receives Ravenal's farewell letter.
Due to time constraints, Whale was forced to delete much of his ending sequence, including a ""modern"" dance number to contrast with the romantic, ""Old South"" production number featuring Kim, and which was intended to highlight black American contributions to dance and music. In order to condense many years' time into the final reel of the film, a number of montages were employed, and up-tempo and down-tempo excerpts of ""Gallivantin' Aroun'"", arranged by Robert Russell Bennett, were used in place of dialog, or under incidental dialog. There was also to have been an additional reprise of ""Ol' Man River"", sung by Paul Robeson in old-age makeup as Joe, but this was deleted, and we never do see an aged Joe (or Queenie) in the film as released.
According to film historian Miles Kreuger in his book Show Boat: The History of a Classic American Musical, great care was taken by director James Whale to ensure a feeling of complete authenticity in the set and costume design for this film.


== Reception ==
Frank S. Nugent of The New York Times called it ""one of the finest musical films we have seen"". Writing for The Spectator in 1936, Graham Greene gave the film a mildly positive review, characterizing the direction as ""fine moneyed smoothness"", and describing the film as ""good entertainment, sentimental, literary, but oddly appealing"". Greene also commented that the film had seen criticism from other viewers that the ending had suffered from ""the extreme sentimentality and improbability of [the final] reunion"".It was the 8th most popular film at the British box office in 1935–36.Ten numbers from the stage score are actually sung, with four others heard only as background music, and a tiny, almost unrecognizable fragment of the song ""I Might Fall Back on You"" is heard instrumentally at the beginning of the New Year's Eve sequence. Except for three new dialogue scenes, the final ten minutes of the film, and the three additional songs written for the movie by Kern and Hammerstein, the 1936 Show Boat follows the stage musical extremely closely, unlike the 1929 film and the 1951 version released by MGM.  It is so faithful that even several instrumental pieces not by Kern which are regularly included as part of the show's score are retained in the film.  The film also retains much of the comedy in the show.


== Temporary withdrawal from circulation ==
Although the film was critically acclaimed and successful at the box office, it was withdrawn from circulation in the 1940s, after Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which wanted to remake the film, bought the rights (and all prints) from Universal. MGM originally wanted  to star Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy in the remake, but those plans fell through. MGM's Show Boat did not begin filming until late 1950, and was released in the summer of 1951 with Kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel in the leading roles.
The fact that Paul Robeson, who had played Joe in the 1936 version, was blacklisted in 1950 further assured that the 1936 film would not be seen for a long time, and it was not widely seen again until after Robeson's death in 1976. In 1983 it made its debut on cable television, and a few years later, on PBS. It was subsequently shown on TNT and now turns up from time to time on TCM.
In 2014, a restoration of the film became available on DVD in the U.S. as part of Warner Home Video's Archive Collection line; and in 2020, a 4K restoration Blu-ray was released by The Criterion Collection.


== Musical additions ==
The three new songs written by Kern and Hammerstein for the 1936 film are:

""I Have The Room Above Her"", a duet for Magnolia and Ravenal, sung in a new scene not included in the original play, but performed approximately in the spot in which the song I Might Fall Back On You was sung by Frank and Ellie, the comic dance team, in the show. ""I Might Fall Back On You"" is not sung in the film; a tiny fragment of it is heard instrumentally in the New Year's Eve sequence. Harold Prince included ""I Have the Room Above Her"" in his 1993 stage revival of Show Boat.
""Gallivantin' Aroun'"", a blackface number, not in the original (in which there are no blackface numbers, per se, although the original Queenie, Tess Gardella, did play her role in blackface). It is sung on the show boat stage by Magnolia, in place of the orchestral Olio Dance performed by Frank in the original play. Certain short excerpts of ""Gallivantin' Aroun'"", played in up-tempo, are utilized towards the ending of the film to signify the passage of many years' time, whereas certain other short excerpts of ""Gallivantin' Aroun'"", played in down-tempo, are utilized towards the ending of the film to represent Kim's first starring performance (seen, very briefly, before the film's final reprises of You Are Love and Ol' Man River).
""Ah Still Suits Me"", a comic duet for Joe and Queenie, written especially to expand both their roles, and sung in a new scene specially written for the film.

== Home media ==
Show Boat was made available on VHS beginning in 1990 (MGM/UA M301757). The Voyager Company, under its Criterion Collection Label, released two versions on laserdisc in 1989 of the 1936 version. One was a special edition with extras that included the history of show boats in general and its stage and film history, and the other was a movie only version. MGM/UA Home Video released the 1929, 1936 and 1951 versions, as well as the Show Boat sequence from Till the Clouds Roll By, as The Complete Show Boat collection on laserdisc in 1995. The 1929 version was restored and this release is the most complete version available. The transfer for the 1936 version is the same as the Criterion Collection and the 1951 was from the restored stereo release MGM had done earlier.
A Brazilian company, Classicline, released a poor quality DVD version in 2003.
In February 2014, a restoration of the film became available on DVD in the U.S. as part of Warner Home Video's Archive Collection line. The initial inventory will be filled by manufactured DVDs; subsequent inventory will be filled by DVDs-on-demand (DVD-Rs). Warner has since discontinued this edition.
In March 2020, Criterion released both a DVD and Blu-ray of this version, with footage from the 1929 version and commentary by Miles Krueger on both the feature film and the 1929 footage, both ported over from the CAV laserdisc release.

== Biography ==
Octavius Josephus van Rysselberghe was born in Minderhout, near Antwerp, on 22 July 1855.He was the older brother of the neo-impressionist painter Théo van Rysselberghe (1862–1926) and the younger brother of fellow architect Charles van Rysselberghe and scientist François van Rysselberghe, pioneer of meteorology and long-distance telephony.He studied at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Ghent and was trained by Adolphe Pauli in the neoclassical tradition, inspired by the Italian Renaissance. In 1875, together with Ernest Allard, he won second prize in the competition of the Prix de Rome for architecture. At the next edition for architecture, in 1879, he again took second prize, together with Eugène Dieltiens.After a stay in Italy, he was a trainee with Joseph Poelaert as part of the construction of the Palais de Justice in Brussels before starting the construction of the Hôtel Goblet d'Alviella for the Count Goblet d'Alviella in 1882. Between 1882 and 1889 he built the Royal Observatory in Uccle, in eclectic and neoclassical styles. In 1893 he built a studio for his brother Théo van Rysselberghe in Saint Clair, France. He built an Art Nouveau house in Brussels, the Hotel Otlet, in 1894. The interior design was done by Henry Van de Velde. He collaborated with Van de Velde also for the Hôtel De Brouckère in Brussels, likewise in a classic and sober Art Nouveau style.Octave van Rysselberghe was soon regarded as one of the most important representatives of Art Nouveau in Belgium. From 1895 to 1905, he built tourist establishments for the Compagnie des Grands Hôtels Européens in Ostend, Cherbourg, Monte Carlo, Saint Petersburg and Tunis.

== Backdrop ==
Literary societies were a feature of most American Colleges and Universities in the 19th century. They often existed in pairs so that they could compete for membership and hold debates. Additionally, they served to enhance the liberal arts programs of their schools through discussions on contemporary topics, hosting speakers, and maintaining libraries.
Literary societies in the United States existed as early as the 18th century. The American Whig–Cliosophic Society was in operation at Princeton in 1769 and the Union-Philanthropic Literary Society was in operation at Hampden-Sydney College in 1789. The North and South Carolina schools followed shortly. The Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies at the University of North Carolina were created in 1795 by a former member of Princeton's Whig Society. In 1806 the Euphradian Society and the Clariosophic Society opened at South Carolina College. In 1837 the Eumenean Society and the Philanthropic Society opened at Davidson College.
Philomathean is among the most common names chosen for a Society. Philomathean is derived from the Greek philomath, which means ""a lover of learning."" The oldest existent Philomathean Literary Society in the U.S. is the  Philomathean Society at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although Philomathean Literary Societies existed at South Carolina's other schools as early as the 19th century, they have since become defunct or rechartered. Robert Barnwell delivered an oration before the Beaufort Philomathean Society in 1803 to commemorate Independence Day. There was also a Society in Charleston from 1828, it was chartered as Phi Mu in 1904.


== History ==
The Associate Reformed Synod of the South was established in 1803 amidst scattered congregations.  Additionally, the Synod's heritage in Scottish churches and their well-educated clergy, led to the need for a seminary. In 1822 , two pastors were appointed to train ministerial candidates. The nascent seminary had no buildings, books, or money. So, when one pastor died in 1829 and the other left in 1831, the Synod moved to create a permanent institution. In 1836, the Clark and Erskine Seminary opened. John S. Pressly was the head of the seminary by 1839. When the seminary was established as the first four-year denominational college in South Carolina, Pressly resigned his position. Ebenezer Erskine Pressly had been a Professor of Divinity at the Erskine Theological Seminary since 1837 and pastor of the Due West Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church. He was thus selected to succeed as head of the school. Four years later, in 1843, the institution's name was shortened to Erskine College.Literary societies followed the foundation of Erskine College almost upon its inception. As at other colleges, the literary societies served to provide training beyond the scope of the classroom in speech making, debating and literature. Their function was to enhance the reputation of the school's liberal arts focus and its prestige by sponsoring famous orators.The Philomathean Literary Society of Erskine College was formed in 1842 when 12 senior students withdrew from the Euphemian Literary Society. The Philomathean society was conceived as a brother society to the Euphemians in order to facilitate debates traditional at other literary society and in the spirit of “iron sharpens iron” taken from Proverbs 27:17. Members of the faculty had participated in literary societies, especially at Miami University, and the tradition was consequently impressed upon students at Erskine.Ebenezer Erskine Pressly had participated in Literary Societies throughout his education. He attended Miami University in Oxford, Ohio in 1824, where he graduated after 2 years at the age of 18. E.E. Pressly was a member of the Erodelphian Literary Society. In 1827, the Erodelphians, with the Miami Union Literary Society, issued the first collegiate publication west of the Appalachians.
The two Erskine Societies initially met in the college's main building with the Euphemians on the second floor and the Philomatheans on the third floor. Each society was responsible for its own hall and library. These libraries were initially the only ones available at the College.The societies became the center of the social and cultural life of the campus in the 1850s. Weekly meetings and annual exhibitions were held in the shared hall. Every Friday afternoon, the societies held declamations followed with debates in the evening. The highlights of campus life were the Junior Exhibitions, which were social events with young women and members of the community in attendance, and the annual summer commencements, which featured acclaimed orators. The two Societies competed for prestige in honoring commencement orators and politicians with membership.During the 19th century, many notable American politicians, theologians and philosophers delivered addresses to the Philomathean Society. In 1844, Benjamin Franklin Perry delivered a speech, published 43 years later by his wife. In 1846, James Lawrence Orr delivered an address at Philomathean Hall which was subsequently published by the Society. The first moderator of the Presbyterian Church, Benjamin M. Palmer, spoke in 1854.In 1844, the argument over the selection of a commencement orator resulted in the most tragic event of the College's history. In Philomathean Hall, Philomathean Peter K. Thompson was murdered by Euphemian Samuel Miller. The faculty issued an explanation to the local paper:
""Mr. Editor:
A most melancholy occurrence transpired in this place, on the evening of the 6th inst. We allude to an affray between two of the students, Samuel Miller and Peter K. Thompson, which resulted in the death of the latter. To prevent misconception and correct exaggerated reports, we send you a statement of the principal facts in the case. The fatal affair occurred in the hall of the Philomathean Society. At the meeting on last Friday, Mr. Miller, it seems, took offence [sic] at the conduct of Mr. Thompson, during the deliberations of the evening. Immediately after the adjournment of the society some angry words were passed, which resulted in a contest, and the event was the death of Mr. Thompson. It was found to have been occasioned by two stabs inflicted, one on the left side, near the region of the heart, and the other about the abdomen. Mr. Thompson expired in fifteen or twenty minutes after a separation was effected. The wounds were inflicted by a pocket knife, with a blade about three and a half inches in length. The whole affair occupied a period, not, perhaps exceeding half a minute. Mr. Miller has been taken into custody, and the matter is under the process of judicial investigation, which forbids that anything should be said which might be prejudicial to either of the parties. We hope, therefore, that the public will suspend their opinion respecting the whole transaction till all the evidence is brought forward in open court.
By authority of the Faculty""Miller was subsequently sentenced to 12 months in prison and fined 1000 dollars.This incident lead to the chartering of the two societies. The Philomathean Literary Society received its charter under the State of South Carolina in 1852.From 1854-1861, the Euphemian and Philomathean Literary Societies cooperated in the editing and printing of the Erskine Collegiate Recorder. The magazine was the only publication from the college other than the annual catalogs. The content was more or less devoid of politics or social commentary. Instead the Recorder was almost entirely composed of literary essays.The year the American Civil War ended, too few students enrolled at Erskine to maintain both societies. From 1865-67 they operated jointly as the Adelphian Society, alternating meetings between the Euphemian and Philomathean Halls. The two societies resumed separate operations before the first degree after the Civil War was conferred.
In 1912, the college adopted the Darlington Cup as the award for the school's society debates. The trophy is made of sterling silver from Tiffany & Co. The donation was granted by Philomathean alumnus J. J. Darlington.1957 saw the establishment of the Philomelean Society at Erskine. Philomelean is Greek for 'lover of poetry'.
The Philomathean Literary Society is associated with several of Erskine College's awards. On an annual basis, the Society recognizes a member of the faculty or staff with the “Man of the Year Award”. The “James Steven Henderson Memorial Scholarship” is awarded in memory of a 1979 graduate with preference given to members of the society.


== Articles and organization ==
The Philomathean and Philomelean Societies operate as Parliaments under Robert's Rules of Order. Each society has adopted individual constitutions under which it appoints officers and grants those officers authority.
In the preamble to the Philomathean constitution, the purpose of the Society is stated as: “The order of mutual benefits derived from the aesthetic expressions of logic, eloquence, and the promotion of the social and cultural aspirations”. The Philomelean constitution carries a similar preamble.
The officers consist of a President, Vice-President, Recording Secretary, Corresponding Secretary and Treasurer. The Philomelean Society carries a similar composition of officers except for the addition of a Chaplain and only one Secretary. The President is required to appoint a Parliamentarian, Historian and Docket Secretary. Furthermore, the President is required to appoint a Tribunal to make determinations concerning infractions. The President is vested with executive powers. Philomathean officers are elected for a term of one year; they must be of at least sophomore standing and have two semesters remaining before graduation.
Additionally, the society has a number of standing committees. These are as follows:

Constitution Committee
Rush Committee
Finance Committee
Service Committee
Social Committee
Debate CommitteeThe committees differ in the Philomelean Society. These are as follows:

Program Committee
Social Committee
House Committee
Publicity Committee
Projects Committee
Alumni Committee
Inter-Society CommitteeDecisions are made by a quorum that must consist of one-half plus one of the current active membership of the society, while orders of the day may be determined by those present. Legislation in the Philomathean Society can only be changed with two-thirds in support.
Infractions are divided into major and minor offenses and differ between the Philomathean and Philomelean Societies.
Minor Offenses in the Philomathean Society include:

Feet propped on chairs
Leaning back in chairs
Destruction of property
Cluttering up the Hall
Speaking without being recognized by the chair
Coming late to meetings
Failing to carry out duties
Failing to attend call meetings
Not sitting in a chair
Pulling a chair out from under a member
Other offenses deemed worthy by the TribunalWhile Major Offenses are defined as ""any offense which jeopardizes the reputation or standards of the Philomathean Literary Society."" Such offenses are determined through consultation of the Executive officers and assessed by the Tribunal.
In the Philomelean Society Minor Offenses are as follow:

Failure to stand and address the chair
Unnecessary noise
Being late to meetingsWhile Major Offenses include:

Improper dress (not wearing jerseys, not dressing for dress meetings)
Unexcused absences from regular events- other than regularly scheduled meetingsMajor offenses result in a fine, failure to appear before court merits a fine per docket offense.
Members may request that they be considered inactive for up to one semester. They must provide a legitimate reason to the President, and receive a majority vote in their favor. Upon their return they must present a letter to the society indicating their intention to return to activity.


== Activities ==
In the past, the Philomathean Society provided training in declamation, essay writing, oratory and debating. These skills were tested in competitions. Lower class members could win medals in declamation and essay writing, while upper class members could win for oratory and debate. The society still participates in the inter-society debate with the Euphemians for the J. J. Darlington Cup.
The society meets weekly. In years past, the meeting was held on Fridays; the afternoon was reserved for essays and declamations, while the evening was used for debates. Additionally, each member prepared two speeches during the school year. Senior members were presented with sheep-skin diplomas, and members were awarded medals for
excellence.
In addition, the society organizes several social functions throughout the year. Some events are organized with the assistance of the Philomelean Society. Specific events have changed since the founding of the society, with new traditions established in place of the old. Alumni accompany Philo women dressed as alumni to join candidate members at an open meeting held early in the school year. This tradition is called the Smoker and intends to expose candidates to the operation of meetings and the advantages of graduating as a member. The Philomeleans host a Halloween costume party, called the Scary Party. A Formal has been held since 1979, when it was first hosted at the Greenwood Country Club. First-year members prepare and serve a breakfast at midnight for Senior members at the Midnight Breakfast. The society hosts two events that celebrate American history, the pre-Gay '90s semi-Formal and the Gay '90s outdoor party. The latter is often held at a nearby lake in spring and celebrates the prosperity of the 1890s, a period that saw the North and South reconcile after undergoing Reconstruction. The Society holds a celebration in the second semester. Finally, at commencement the Philomathean and Euphemian Societies hold a joint celebration.
The Philomathean and Philomelean members celebrate their members marital engagements. Members of the Philomathean Society ""serenade"" engaged Philo women by standing outside her window and singing. During the '70s a book of songs existed that has since fallen into disuse. Philomeleans slide notes under the doors of their membership inviting them to a ""Candle-Lighting"". At the time designated by the note, Philo women gather and sing Tell Me Why while passing a burning candle in a circle. When the candle reaches the engaged women on the second round of the circle, she blows it out and announces her engagement.


== Membership ==

Membership to the Philomathean Society is open to all male students of Erskine College. Women may apply after their first semester to the Philomelean Society. Members are collectively known as “philo”.The societies have different traditions for inducting new members. Each society is individually responsible for establishing its own membership committee and for the events held during the admission period.
Students who apply for membership to the Philomathean or Philomelean Societies must complete the tasks assigned by the membership committee in a two-week period at the beginning of the school year called Rush. Before a student is allowed to apply to the Philomelean Society, she must attend at least two open events. Philomathean potentials also need to qualify for rushee status. Candidates must attend a social event called a Smoker, after which the standing membership votes on each potential rushee. Once the candidate has been voted into Rush, he/she is assigned a sponsor. Freshmen and transfer students are ineligible during their first semester.
At the beginning of Rush, candidates are placed under a sponsor and given a file of instructions. The Philomelean candidates are required to wear a name tag throughout Rush. In the Philomathean Society, rushees are given a pin and a Rush name that is not to be used outside of the society. During Rush, potential candidates are required to follow a number of traditions and meet several objectives. The candidate must learn the names of all Philomathean Brothers or Philomelean Sisters and acquire their signatures. Tradition holds that the signatures of senior students should be sought first, out of respect. Signatures are often granted only once a requested deed or favor is performed by the candidate.
Candidates may only miss two events during Rush. Additionally, candidates are required to organize at least one event, a fundraiser, on their own. There are several permanent events during the Rush period. The Philomelean Society holds a poetry night where the candidates must recite a poem in a dramatic fashion. Both Societies require a Constitution Test that measures knowledge of Robert's Rules of Order and the laws of the society. The Philomathean Society conducts a History Test; candidates must exceed 60% to be considered, though anything less than 90% is usually insufficient. Philomelean rushees must do something for their sponsors on Sponsor Day. The Rush Party allows members from both societies to mingle. Philomathean candidates must attend three regular meetings in coat and tie. Both societies have a Cook-Out. Accompanying activities vary between the two, although the event is attended by both societies. Philomeleans must wear a tuxedo-jacket with tie and serve their sponsor at the Cook-Out. The Philomatheans organize the Cook-Out, which consists of an outdoor bonfire with a pig roasted and served by the rushees.
Finally on Vote Night, the potential Philomelean candidates must provide their signature list, a letter to the society thanking it for the opportunity to participate in Rush and wear a themed costume. Philomathean rushees are required to give a speech, and sponsors must report on a number of the rushees' qualities, personality traits, and past achievements.
Alumni retain their membership in the societies and the privileges accorded to members. They are not expected to pay dues.


== Motto and letters ==

The motto is the Latin ""Tentare Est Valere"", or ""To try is to be worthy"", along with the letters 'N' 'D', which stand for ""Nil Desperandum"", or ""Despair in no way"". The letters are derived from Horace's Odes. The motto and letters read together illustrate the classical liberal arts and Christian educational aspirations of the college. The motto is similar to a number of passages in the Bible, such as Luke 13:24, which state that worth is the result of careful conduct and agonizing effort. Moreover, the letters reinforce the New Testament notion of worth through a classical theme. Teucer undergoes a voyage of discovery and personal suffering, finally establishing the city of Salamis. The theme of his speech is further reinforced by valere, which is also used as a parting phrase. A broad translation of valere also signifies strength, power, and wellness.
The letters of the Society are Alpha (Adelphos-Brotherhood); Alpha (Areta- Virtue); Sigma (Sophia- Wisdom); Epsilon (Elpis- Hope); and Sigma (Sophrosuna- Self-Control). The letters offer a code of conduct that reinforces the themes established by the motto. First, brotherhood recalls the core purpose of the society, but revisits the story of Teucer who was sent into exile because he failed to honor his brother's death. Virtue recalls biblical passages similar to the motto, advising conduct that follows the example of Christ. Wisdom returns to the motto, playing on one of the meanings of tentare, to prove or to test. Hope reiterates Nil Desperandum. And, self-control recalls the biblical influences of the motto.


== Philomathean Hall ==

The Philomathean Hall is the oldest building in the Erskine College-Due West Historic District. As such, it is a contributing property in the National Register of Historic Places. It was constructed in 1859, under the direction of architect Thomas Veal. The building was constructed in the Italian Renaissance Revival style. The two-story stuccoed building features Corinthian pilasters, a pedimented pavilion, recessed balustrades and a Palladian window. The Hall demonstrates the influence of  Andrea Palladio as it bears close resemblance to the Villa Capra ""La Rotonda"" and the Villa Porto (Vivaro di Dueville). Palladio's geometrically formulaic design is echoed in the Philomathean Hall's 50x40 footprint, symmetrically placed windows and interior floor plan that conforms to the windows exterior placement. The open second floor meeting hall celebrates this geometry with its painted high ceiling, flanking fireplaces, and 14 symmetrically placed windows, while the downstairs rooms are dimensioned to match the window placement, a schematic that still challenges contemporary architects. The architectural similarities between the Hall and colonial American buildings, such as those at Mount Vernon, Monticello, and the White House, are thematic of the early 19th century. Additionally, the Hall is aesthetically tied to other South Carolina buildings. It possesses characteristics similar to those found in Hibernian Hall and Drayton Hall. Leaks in the internal gutter have caused significant damage to the jewel-box painting on the ceiling of the great hall on the second floor, which was added in the 1912 J.J. Darlington renovation. The ceiling and wall frescoes were painted by Italian painter Alfredo Lanzer.


== Notable Philomatheans ==
Joseph Neely Miller (1848-after 1904) - a prominent lawyer and active member of the Democratic organization. Was chosen for the presidential ticket.J.J. Darlington (1849–1920)- was a Washington based lawyer. A Diana statue in Judiciary Square stands in memorial to him. Darlington was a lawyer for the respondent in Gompers v. Buck's Stove and Range Co., a prominent case regarding the First Amendment rights of workers and laborers organized in unions. Additionally, Darlington served on the Erskine board of trustees.Leo Hill (1927–2010) - served as president of the Philomathean Literary Society. In 1968, Hill was elected as the President of the South Carolina Bar at the age of 41, making him the youngest to obtain the post. He is credited with modernizing South Carolina's bond laws and creating the state's Public Defender and Legal Services Agencies. Additionally, Hill served as South Carolina Supreme Court appointee to the state Judicial Council, as secretary to the Greenville County Democratic Party and as City Attorney and Special Counsel.Kent D. Talbert- served as president of the Erskine Student Government Association. He was nominated in 2005 by President Bush to serve as General Counsel to the U.S. Department of Education.John C.

As at April 2020, IXPN is the 5th largest IXP in Africa by number of peers, and 3rd in Africa by traffic according to Packet Clearing House’s IXP directory


== History ==
The first attempt at an IXP in Nigeria - Ibadan Internet Exchange (Ib-IX) - was in 2003. This was a layer-2 infrastructure, precisely, a 24-port 10/100Mbit/s switch and a route server with two Ibadan based ISPs – SKANNET and Steineng Ltd- as members. The maximum recorded traffic between these two ISPs was 690kbit/s. It existed for just about six months but was able to demonstrate to ISPAN members that an IXP was feasible in Nigeria.
In November 2005, during former President Olusegun Obasanjo’s presidency, an IXP setup committee was constituted. The members of this committee were drawn from NCC, ISPAN, Medallion Communications, Interconnect Nigeria Ltd and so on. In early 2006, the Board of NCC, approved a proposal to partly fund the setting-up of Internet eXchange Points in Nigeria. Later that year, IXPN started operations from NECOM House (Marina, Lagos) as its main location; with sub-locations at Victoria Island, Lagos, Ikeja, Lekki Port Harcourt, Abuja, Enugu and Kano.


== Current ==
IXPN currently has four Points-of-Presence (POPs) in Lagos and four outside Lagos, covering five geo-political zones of Nigeria. IXPN has over 60 Networks connected on its platform, with Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), Internet Service Providers (ISPs), Content Providers , DDoS mitigation services, Web Hosting companies and educational institutions currently exchanging internet traffic at an average rate of 220Gbit/sIn 2019, IXPN became regional internet exchange for West Africa   with the support of the African Union Commission (AU). In 2016, following a response to a call for proposals issued by AU, IXPN was awarded a grant to be supported to grow to become a regional internet Internet Exchange for West Africa.
In February 2020, IXPN signed a memorandum of understanding with DE-CIX. The first phase of this partnership involves DE-CIX educating local African networks, Internet service providers and content service providers about the benefits of peering and further interconnection services.

He is the chief technology officer of Turkish technology company Baykar and the architect of Turkey’s first indigenous and operational unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems. He is also the founding chairman of the Turkish Technology Team Foundation.,"Selçuk Bayraktar (born 7 October 1979) is a Turkish engineer and businessman. He is the chief technology officer of Turkish technology company Baykar and the architect of Turkey’s first indigenous and operational unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems. He is also the founding chairman of the Turkish Technology Team Foundation.


== Early life and education ==
Originally from Trabzon, Bayraktar was born in 1979 in the Sarıyer district of Istanbul, the second child of Özdemir Bayraktar and Canan Bayraktar. His father Özdemir (1948-2021) established the Turkish aerospace firm, also named Beyraktar, in 1984. Selçuk began his education in Sarıyer Primary School, thereafter enrolling in Robert College from which he graduated in 1997. In that year, he began higher education in the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering at Istanbul Technical University. During his undergraduate education, he received a scholarship from the GRASP Laboratory at University of Pennsylvania, where he received a master's degree in 2004. His master's degree research involved a successful demonstration of air–ground coordination of UAVs in formation flight alongside territorial robot teams. This work attracted attention and he was offered a further scholarship by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Pursuing his studies under the supervision of George Pappas and Eric Feron, Bayraktar earned his second master’s degree with his research in autonomous, aggressive maneuvering of unmanned helicopter systems.


== Career ==
Following his education, he returned to Turkey in 2007 and become the chief technology officer of Baykar. Under his leadership, Baykar has developed Bayraktar UAVs, Turkey’s first indigenous UAV project, including the Bayraktar Mini UAV, Bayraktar TB2, Bayraktar VTOL and Bayraktar Akıncı. These vehicles were used by Turkish security forces in counterterrorism operations against PKK and participated in conflicts such as the Syrian Civil War, the Second Libyan Civil War, the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War and the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine. In March 2021, Bayraktar announced a new UAV model Bayraktar TB3, which is a MALE class UAV, and an addendum to the company designated TB series UAV's after Bayraktar TB2. The new aircraft is planned to be deployed on Turkey's first amphibious assault ship TCG Anadolu. In April 2021, Bayraktar announced their target to conduct the maiden flight of Turkey's first domestically-made unmanned fighter jet in 2023.One other significant project that Bayraktar leads is Turkey’s first flying car (manned eVTOL) project Cezeri. Cezeri demonstrated its first flight in September 2020 with hovering autonomously 10 meters above ground. The vehicle and the flight was covered in global media widely.


== Philanthropy ==
Bayraktar gives utmost importance to the National Technology Initiative pursued by Turkey that aims to establish a local and indigenous high-technology environment. Therefore, in addition to his professional work, he holds the founding chairmanship of the Turkish Technology Team Foundation. The foundation aims to raise public awareness and educate talented youth to promote the necessary ecosystem for the national development of high technology in Turkey. It holds maker lab workshops at cities around the country which Bayraktar frequently attends. He is also chairman of the Teknofest annual aerospace and technology festival. It holds pre-funded technology competitions and exhibits technology enterprises that have been brought from around the world. With hosting more than 1.7 million visitors in 2019, the organization has become the most visited aerospace and technology festival. Bayraktar played a crucial role during the COVID-19 pandemic with leading major tech companies of Turkey to design and manufacture the nation's first ICU-type medical ventilation machine.


== Personal life ==
He married Sümeyye Erdoğan, daughter of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, in 2016 and has a child with her. He has a private pilot license.


== Awards ==
 — He was awarded the Karabakh Order by the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev  on 1 April 2021.

== Biography ==
Fleischer studied with Leonard Bernstein as a conducting fellow at Tanglewood in 1989. He served as the Assistant Conductor of the American Symphony Orchestra from 1986 to 1989. While working toward his Master of Music degree at the Indiana University School of Music, he served as chorus master of the Indiana University Opera Theater program from 1983 to 1985. Fleischer received his Bachelor of Music Education from the Oberlin Conservatory of Music and studied conducting privately with Otto-Werner Mueller and in Master classes with Seiji Ozawa, Riccardo Muti, Gustav Meier, and others.
Fleischer appeared as a guest conductor with many major orchestras in the United States and internationally including repeat engagements with the Israel Philharmonic, Los Angeles Philharmonic, San Francisco Symphony, St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, Seattle Symphony, Utah Symphony, San Diego Symphony, Philadelphia Chamber Orchestra and others.
Fleischer first came to international attention when, while serving his first of five years as Assistant, then Associate conductor of the National Symphony Orchestra, he conducted Dvorak’s Cello Concerto with Mstislav Rostropovich as soloist during the NSO’s 1990 tour of Japan and the U.S.S.R. This was the first time Rostropovich had played the cello in Russia since his forced exile in 1972. Fleischer was featured in the internationally broadcast PBS documentary “Soldier of Music” which documented Rostropovich’s return to the Soviet Union and was also featured on the “60 Minutes” segment on this event. “Soldier of Music” was later released on the Sony Video label.
In 1995 Fleischer made his debut with New York City Opera conducting “The Magic Flute.” Fleischer’s operatic repertoire included productions of La Bohème, Turandot, Tosca, Madama Butterfly, Don Giovanni, La Traviata, and others.

Carlos Nakai, Burning Sky, The Hawk Project, The Benally Family, and others. As an advocate of new music, Fleischer  commissioned and conducted world premieres and works by living composers.
An educator, Fleischer co-authored several instructional pieces for children in collaboration with his wife, comedian Heidi Joyce, which were premiered by the National Symphony Orchestra, including three rap pieces for orchestra. In January 1991, Joyce and Fleischer co-authored and premiered “Martin Luther King, Jr.: A Spiritual Journey” with the NSO, a piece for narrator and orchestra which explores the history of the civil rights movement with excerpts of King’s speeches, narrated for King’s daughter, Yolanda King. This piece was broadcast on PBS in February 1995.
Fleischer co-created with Rob Evan Rocktopia, a mix of classical music and classic rock, which in March 2018 began a six-week run at the Broadway Theatre.

== Biography ==
Aikawa was born in what is now part of Yamaguchi city, Yamaguchi prefecture. His mother was the niece of Meiji period genrō Inoue Kaoru. He graduated from the engineering department of Tokyo Imperial University in 1903 and went to work for Shibaura Seisakusho, the forerunner of Toshiba.Although his pay was very low, Aikawa managed to save enough to make a trip to the United States, where he studied malleable cast iron technology. After his return to Japan, with the backing of Inoue Kaoru and other ex-Chōshū politicians in the Diet of Japan, he established the Tobata Foundry in Kitakyūshū in 1909. The company is now known as Hitachi Kinzoku (Hitachi Metals Company Ltd).
In 1928, Aikawa became president of the Kuhara Mining Company (present day Nippon Mining & Metals Company) taking over from his brother-in-law Fusanosuke Kuhara and created a holding company called Nihon Sangyo, or Nissan for short.  Kuhara went on to a career in politics, forging ties with future Prime Minister Giichi Tanaka and other political and military leaders, which Aikawa would later use to his advantage.In the stock market boom following the 1931 Manchurian Incident, Aikawa used the opportunity to buy majority shareholdings in 132 subsidiary companies of Nissan to create a new zaibatsu, the Nissan Group (日産コンツェルン, Nissan Kontserun, ""Nissan Concern""). The companies included Nissan Motors, Isuzu, NEC Corporation, Nippon Mining Holdings Company, Nissan Chemicals, Hitachi, Nichiyu Corporation, Nichirei Corporation, Nissan Marine Insurance, Nissan Mutual Life Insurance and others. The group included some of the most technologically advanced companies in Japan at the time.In 1937, at the invitation of his relative Nobusuke Kishi, he moved to Manchukuo and agreed with the Japanese Kwantung Army's vision of a syndicalist economy and centralized industrial development plan for Manchukuo. He also moved the headquarters of Nissan to Manchukuo, where it became the core of the Manchurian Industrial Development Company, a new Manchukuo zaibatsu.
In his position as president and chairman, Aikawa guided all industrial efforts in Manchukuo, implementing two five-year plans during the 1930s that followed the economic and industrial vision of army ideologist, Naoki Hoshino. However, Aikawa differed from Hoshino's original conception in that he favored a more monopolistic approach. He argued that the economic state of Manchukuo was still too primitive to permit free market capitalism. Aikawa also received bank loans from American steel industrialists to support the Manchukuo economy, which created considerable controversy in the United States with its policy of Non-recognition.
However, while his economic views were in line with Imperial Japanese Army policy, his political views were not. Aikawa was a strong opponent of the Tripartite Pact, and predicted that the forces of the United Kingdom and France would eventually prevail over Nazi Germany should a general war break out. He supported the Fugu Plan, a project to settle Jewish refugees in Manchukuo. In 1942, at the instigation of the Kwantung Army, Aikawa resigned chairman of the Manchurian Industrial Development Company, and moved back to Japan.After the surrender of Japan, Aikawa was arrested by the American occupation authorities and incarcerated in Sugamo Prison for 20 months as a Class A war crimes suspect. He was freed before his case came to trial, however, during this time, the Nissan zaibatsu was dissolved.
After his release, Aikawa played a key role in post-war economic reconstruction of Japan, and purchased a commercial bank to organize loans to small companies. He served as president of Teikoku Oil Company and of the Japan Petroleum Exploration Company, and in 1953, was elected to a seat in the House of Councilors of the Diet of Japan. With the help of Nobusuke Kishi, then prime minister, he achieved his goal in implementing economic-control law and policies as leader of the Chuseiren, a pressure group that became the main federation of small and medium-sized companies in the 1960s.
Aikawa died of acute gall bladder inflammation in 1967. His grave is at the Tama Cemetery outside Tokyo.

== E.A. Patras Volleyball - A1 Ethniki ==
E.A. Patras was one of the protagonists after the establishment of the Greek volleyball league in the 1930s, winning the title in 1937-38 and being the runner-up in the seasons 1935-36, 1936–37 and 1939-1940.
E.A.P. returned to the first Greek league for the first time after the formation of the A1 Ethniki Volleyball, by winning the A2 Ethniki title in 1999. It took the fifth place in A1 Ethniki two times in a row (2003–04, 2004–05) and during those three years it participated in the European Federation Cup.
The season (2008–2009) was the most successful so far for EAP in the post-war period. It took the 3rd place in the national championship which allowed the club to participate once more to the European Federation Cup in the season 2009-2010.
The next season (2009–2010) the club held an impressive record during the regular season of the A1 Ethniki Volleyball with 18 wins, 4 losses and 53 points, finishing in the second place, only behind Panathinaikos VC. But in the playoffs the club's performance was disappointing ending up in the 7th place of the league.
In the season 2010-2011, EAP finished in the fifth place in the championship.


== Greek Cup ==
Apart from Athens' and Thessaloniki's major volleyball clubs, EAP - representing Patras - was the fourth club from a provincial Greek city that made it to the final of the Greek Volleyball Cup, in the season 2007-2008.

It was once considered the third most important in the city after the Duomo and the Basilica di Sant'Ambrogio. It is dedicated to saint Babylas of Antioch.


== History and Description ==
At the beginning of the 5th century, Marolus, the bishop of Milan, brought from Antioch to Milan relics of saints Babylas of Antioch and Romanus of Caesarea. Marolus founded the Basilica Concilia Sanctorum or church of San Romano, which stood until the 19th century, a few meters south of the church of San Babila, on the site of a Roman temple dedicated to the Sun.
The church of San Babila was built on the same site in about 1095. In the 16th century, the church was extended with an additional construction at the front and a new baroque façade. The church still retains its original medieval fabric, although much was lost due to baroque and modern renovations.The whole complex was renovated in the 19th century with the intent of restoring the appearance of the medieval basilica, and in the early 20th century, Paolo Cesa Bianchi designed the Neo-Romanesque façade that we now see.Previous to 1927, the church had a Mannerist facade with pilasters and a protruding portal with columns and a roofline surmounted by spherical pinnacles with palm-leaves above. The bell tower is from 1920, and replaced the original tower which fell down in the 16th century. The column in front of the church dates to the 18th-century and has a lion atop, a symbol of the neighborhood.The interior has a nave and two aisles; it ends in typical multilobular semicircular Romanesque apses. There are two side chapels that date from the late Renaissance. The right aisle has an image of the Madonna which is highly venerated by the Milanese population.

Inside the basilica there is a Zanin pipe organ (2008), completely made with a mechanical transmission system. The instrument, inspired by the German baroque organs, is used for liturgies and concerts. Currently, the titular organist of the basilica is Michele Zanella.

== Origins ==

Jones et al. (2015) analyzed genomes from males from western Georgia, in the Caucasus, from the Late Upper Palaeolithic (13,300 years old) and the Mesolithic (9,700 years old). These two males carried Y-DNA haplogroup: J* and J2a, later refined to J1-FT34521, and J2-Y12379*, and mitochondrial haplogroups of K3 and H13c, respectively. Their genomes showed that a continued mixture of the Caucasians with Middle Eastern populations took place up to 25,000 years ago, when the coldest period in the last Ice Age started.CHG ancestry was also found in an Upper Palaeolithic specimen from Satsurblia cave (dated ca. 11000 BC), and in a Mesolithic one from Kotias Klde cave, in western Georgia (dated ca. 7700 BC). The Satsurblia individual is closest to modern populations from the South Caucasus.Fu et al. (2016), comparing CHG to the 13,700 year-old Bichon man genome (found in Switzerland) detected a split between CHG and ""Western European Hunter-Gatherer"" (WHG) lineages, about 45,000 years ago, the presumed time of the original peopling of Europe. CHG separated from the ""Early Anatolian Farmers"" (EAF) lineage later, at 25,000 years ago, during the Last Glacial Maximum.Margaryan et al. (2017) analysing South Caucasian ancient mitochondrial DNA found a rapid increase of the population at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum, about 18,000 years ago. The same study also found continuity in descent in the maternal line for 8,000 years.According to Narasimhan et al. (2019) Iranian farmer related people arrived before 6000 BCE in Pakistan and north-west India, before the advent of farming in northern India. They suggest the possibility that this ""Iranian farmer–related ancestry [...] was [also] characteristic of northern Caucasus and Iranian plateau hunter-gatherers.""


== Proto-Indo Europeans ==

The proto-Indo-Europeans, i.e. the Yamnaya people and the related cultures, seem to have been a mix from Eastern European Hunter-Gatherers (EHGs); and people related to the near east, either Caucasus hunter-gatherers or Iran Chalcolithic people, with a Caucasian hunter-gatherer component.  Each of those two populations contributed about half the Yamnaya DNA. According to co-author Andrea Manica of the University of Cambridge:

The question of where the Yamnaya come from has been something of a mystery up to now […] we can now answer that, as we've found that their genetic make-up is a mix of Eastern European hunter-gatherers and a population from this pocket of Caucasus hunter-gatherers who weathered much of the last Ice Age in apparent isolation.
According to Jones et al. (2015), Caucasus hunter-gatherers (CHG) ""genomes significantly contributed to the Yamnaya steppe herders who migrated into Europe ~3,000 BCE, supporting a formative Caucasus influence on this important Early Bronze Age culture. CHG left their imprint on modern populations from the Caucasus and also central and south Asia possibly marking the arrival of Indo-Aryan languages.""Lazaridis et al. (2016) proposes a different people, likely from Iran, as the source for the Middle Eastern ancestry of the Yamnaya people, finding that ""a population related to the people of the Iran Chalcolithic contributed ~43% of the ancestry of early Bronze Age populations of the steppe"". That study asserts that these Iranian Chalcolithic people were a mixture of ""the Neolithic people of western Iran, the Levant, and Caucasus Hunter Gatherers"".Gallego-Llorente et al. (2016) conclude that Iranian populations are not a likelier source of the 'southern' component in the Yamnaya than Caucasus hunter-gatherers.Wang et al. (2018) analysed genetic data of the North Caucasus of fossils dated between the 4th and 1st millennia BC and found correlation with modern groups of the South Caucasus, concluding that ""unlike today – the Caucasus acted as a bridge rather than an insurmountable barrier to human movement"".CHG admixture was also found in South Asia, in a possible marker of the Indo-Aryan migration there.


== Ancient Greece and Aegean ==
Beyond contributing to the population of mainland Europe through Bronze Age pastoralists of the Yamnaya, CHG also appears to have arrived on its own in the Aegean without eastern European hunter–gatherer ancestry and provided approximately 9–32% of ancestry to the Minoans. The origin of this CHG component might have been Central Anatolia.

Areal velocity,"['Curves', 'Kinematic properties']","In classical mechanics, areal velocity (also called sector velocity or sectorial velocity) is a pseudovector whose length equals the rate of change at which area is swept out by a particle as it moves along a curve. In the adjoining figure, suppose that a particle moves along the blue curve. At a certain time t, the particle is located at point B, and a short while later, at time t + Δt, the particle has moved to point C. The region swept out by the particle is shaded in green in the figure, bounded by the line segments AB and AC and the curve along which the particle moves. The areal velocity magnitude (i.e., the areal speed) is this region's area divided by the time interval Δt in the limit that Δt becomes vanishingly small. The vector direction is postulated normal to the plane containing the position and velocity vectors of the particle, following a convention known as the right hand rule.

The concept of areal velocity is closely linked historically with the concept of angular momentum.  Kepler's second law states that the areal velocity of a planet, with the sun taken as origin, is constant. Isaac Newton was the first scientist to recognize the dynamical significance of Kepler's second law.  With the aid of his laws of motion, he proved in 1684 that any planet that is attracted to a fixed center sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time.  By the middle of the 18th century, the principle of angular momentum was discovered gradually by Daniel Bernoulli and Leonhard Euler and Patrick d'Arcy; d'Arcy's version of the principle was phrased in terms of swept area.  For this reason, the principle of angular momentum was often referred to in the older literature in mechanics as ""the principle of equal areas.""  Since the concept of angular momentum includes more than just geometry, the designation ""principle of equal areas"" has been dropped in modern works.","In classical mechanics, areal velocity (also called sector velocity or sectorial velocity) is a pseudovector whose length equals the rate of change at which area is swept out by a particle as it moves along a curve.

== Connection with angular momentum ==
In the situation of the first figure, the area swept out during time period Δt by the particle is approximately equal to the area of triangle ABC.  As Δt approaches zero this near-equality becomes exact as a limit.
Let the point D be the fourth corner of parallelogram ABDC shown in the figure, so that the vectors AB and AC add up by the parallelogram rule to vector AD. Then the area of triangle ABC is half the area of parallelogram ABDC, and the area of ABDC is equal to the magnitude of the cross product of vectors AB and AC.  This area can also be viewed as a (pseudo)vector with this magnitude, and pointing in a direction perpendicular to the parallelogram (following the right hand rule); this vector is the cross product itself:

Hence

The areal velocity is this vector area divided by Δt in the limit that Δt becomes vanishingly small:

== History ==


=== Native Americans ===
Paleo-Indians (hunter-gatherers) existed thousands of years ago on the Trans-Pecos, and often did not adapt to culture clashes, European diseases, and colonization.  The Masames tribe was exterminated by the Tobosos, circa 1652.  The Nonojes suffered from clashes with the Spanish and merged with the Tobosos.  The Spanish made slave raids to the La Junta de los Ríos, committing cruelties against the native population.  The Suma-Jumano tribe sought to align themselves with the Spanish for survival.  The tribe later merged with the Apache people. Foraging peoples who did not survive the 18th century include the Chisos, Mansos, Jumanos, Conchos, Julimes, Cibolos, Tobosos, Sumas, Cholomes, Caguates, Nonojes, Cocoyames, and Acoclames.


=== Early explorations and settlements ===
The entrada of Juan Domínguez de Mendoza  and Father Nicolás López in 1683–84 set out from El Paso to La Junta, where they established seven missions at seven pueblos.  In 1683, Father López celebrated the first Christmas Mass in Texas at La Junta.
In 1832, José Ygnacio Ronquillo was issued a conditional land grant, and established the county's first white settlement on Cibolo Creek. Military obligations forced him to abandon the settlement, and he then sold the land.The Chihuahua Trail connecting Mexico's state of Chihuahua with Santa Fe, New Mexico, opened in 1839.By 1848, Ben Leaton built Fort Leaton, sometimes called the largest adobe structure in Texas, on the river as his home, trading post, and private bastion. Leaton died in debt in 1851, with the fort passing to the holder of the mortgage, John Burgess. In 1934, T. C. Mitchell and the Marfa State Bank acquired the old structure and donated it to the county as a historic site. The park was opened to the public in 1978.Milton Faver became the county's first cattle baron. In 1857, he moved his family to Chinati Mountains in the county. Milton Faver bought small tracts of land around three springs-Cibolo, Cienega, and La Morita and established cattle ranches. He built Fort Cienega and Fort Cibolo.


=== County established and growth ===
Presidio County was established from Bexar County on January 3, 1850. Fort Leaton became the county seat.  The county was organized in 1875 as the largest county in the United States, with 12,000 square miles (31,000 km2). Fort Davis was named the county seat. The boundaries and seat of Presidio County were changed in the 1880s. Marfa was established in 1883, and the county seat was moved there from Fort Davis in 1885.In 1854, the army built Fort Davis in northern Presidio County.
Fort Davis closed during the Civil War and reopened in 1867.  The black population increased to 489 when Buffalo Soldiers were stationed at Fort Davis.John W. Spencer, a local rancher and trader, found a silver deposit in the Chinati Mountains in 1880 that resulted in the opening of Presidio Mine and the beginning of the company town of Shafter.  From 1883 until 1942, the mine produced over 32.6 million ounces of silver.The railroad reached Presidio County in 1882, when the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway laid tracks through its northeastern corner.

W. F. Mitchell built the first barbed wire fence in the county at Antelope Springs in 1888. The widespread use of barbed wire resulted in the refinement of cattle breeds, improvement of ranges, and innovative use of water supplies.Windmills, water wells, and earthen tanks were introduced on Presidio County ranches in the late 1880s.Elephant Butte Dam was built in 1910 on the Rio Grande, creating a large, reliable irrigation source for the county.The growth of Presidio County's population in the 1910s reflected the impact of the Mexican Revolution on border life. Refugees migrated to the county from Chihuahua as the fighting moved into northern Mexico. The United States Army established several posts in the county. Marfa became the headquarters for the Big Bend Military District, and in 1917, the Army established Camp Marfa, later called Fort D. A. Russell, at Marfa to protect the border. As Presidio County entered the 1930s the people faced a drought and a population decline. Low silver prices closed Presidio Mine at Shafter. Economic recovery began by 1936.  During World War II, Presidio County enjoyed economic prosperity as the home for two military installations-Fort Russell and Marfa Army Airfield.In late January 1918, during a period of tension between the US and Mexico, Texas Rangers and citizens of the village of Porvenir murdered 15 local Hispanic residents.The economy of the county in 1982 was based primarily on agriculture, with 83% of the land in farms and ranches.


=== Marfa Lights ===

Wagon trains on the Chihuahua Trail reported seeing unexplained lights in the mid-19th century. The first recorded incident of the Marfa Lights was in 1883 when Robert Reed Ellison and cowhands camped at Mitchell Flats.
They thought the lights might have been Apaches, but later found no evidence of an Apache encampment. Since that time, the lights continue to appear between Marfa and Paisano Pass. Speculation and fascination spark imaginations about the source.  Some say they are caused by car headlights; some say extraterrestrial visitors.  One theory is that the lights are similar to a mirage caused by atmospheric conditions.  Marfa celebrates with a Mystery Lights Festival every Labor Day.


== Geography ==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 3,856 square miles (9,990 km2), of which 3,855 square miles (9,980 km2) are land and 0.7 square miles (1.8 km2) (0.02%) is covered by water. It is the fourth-largest county in Texas by area.
Presidio County is triangular in shape and is bounded on the east by Brewster County, on the north by Jeff Davis County, and on the south and west for 135 miles (217 km) by the Rio Grande and Mexico. Marfa, the county seat, is 190 miles (306 km) southeast of El Paso and 150 miles (241 km) southwest of Odessa. The center of the county lies at 30°30' north latitude and 104°15' west longitude.
Geographically, Presidio County comprises 3,857 square miles (9,990 km2) of contrasting topography, geology, and vegetation. In the north and west, clay and sandy loam cover the rolling plains known as the Marfa Plateau and the Highland Country, providing good ranges of grama grasses for the widely acclaimed Highland Herefords. In the central, far western, and southeastern areas of the county, some of the highest mountain ranges in Texas are found. These peaks are formed of volcanic rock and covered with loose surface rubble. They support desert shrubs and cacti and dominate a landscape of rugged canyons and numerous springs. The spring-fed Capote Falls, with a drop of 175 feet (53 m), the highest in Texas, is located in western Presidio County. In the southern and western parts of the county, the volcanic cliffs of the Candelaria Rimrock (also called the Sierra Vieja) rise perpendicular and run parallel to the river, separating the highland prairies from the desert floor hundreds of feet below them. The gravel pediment, which allows only the growth of desert shrubs and cacti, extends from the Rimrock to the flood plain of the river. Along the river, irrigation allows the farming of vegetables, grains, and cotton. No permanent streams exist in the county, although many arroyos become raging torrents during heavy rainfalls. Major ones are Alamito Creek, Cibolo Creek, Capote Creek, and Pinto Canyon. San Esteban Dam was built across Alamito Creek and on the site of a historic spring-fed tinaja in 1911 as an irrigation and land-promotion project. Altitudes in the county vary from 2,518 to 7,728 feet (767 to 2,355 m) above sea level. Temperatures, moderated by the mountains, vary from 33 °F (1 °C) in January to 100 °F (38 °C) in July. Average rainfall is  12 inches (300 mm) per year, mainly in June, July, and August. The growing season extends for 238 days. Natural resources under production in 1982 were perlite, crushed rhyolite, sand, and gravel. Silver mining contributed greatly to the economy of the county from the 1880s to the 1940s. Presidio County has no oil or gas production.

Presidio County's unusual shape has it facing more of Mexico than the rest of the United States. The county is bounded on the east by Brewster County, on the north by Jeff Davis County, and on the south and west for 135 miles (217 km) by the Rio Grande and Mexico. Along the international border, the county faces the Manuel Benavides and Ojinaga Districts of the state of Chihuahua, Mexico, on the south side, and the municipality of Guadalupe of the State of Chihuahua, Mexico, on its southwestern side.

== Climate ==
More than half of Presidio County, 54.6%, experiences a hot arid desert climate (Köppen BWh). The remainder has a semiarid steppe climate with 34.7% classified as a cold steppe climate (Köppen BSk) and 10.8% as a hot steppe climate (Köppen BSh). Temperatures are coolest and rainfall most abundant in the higher elevations of the Davis and Chinati Mountains. By contrast, the lowlands along the Rio Grande along the southern and western areas of the county are dry with often extreme summer daytime heat and where winter snowfall is unusual. Throughout the county, May through October marks the rainy season, while the remainder of the year is predominantly dry.

It consisted of Odetta and Lawrence B. Mohr, the former of whom became the more well known in ensuing decades.


== Background ==
Odetta Holmes and Lawrence B. Mohr met at a bar called ""The Lamp"" on Kearney Street in North Beach, San Francisco in 1953, the area that the Beatniks were soon to inspire. Odetta was in San Francisco because she was travelling with the chorus of Finian's Rainbow. Lawrence (Larry) had just finished college at the University of Chicago, and travelled to San Francisco with his best friend who was shipping overseas into the Navy.
""The Lamp"" was famous for its musical environment. People would spend evenings there jamming with guitars, banjos, and other musical instruments. On one fateful evening in the summer of 1953, Larry began playing a Lead Belly song and Odetta joined in harmony. They jammed together, and that was the beginning.


== Tin Angel ==
Odetta was becoming known around North Beach, San Francisco and stayed in town after Finian’s Rainbow left. She was hired to sing at a club called The Purple Onion, which made her well known in the club-arena. Shortly thereafter, Odetta was hired by Peggy Tolk-Watkins, owner of the Tin Angel, to sing most evenings at the club. When she saw how well Odetta grooved with Larry, Peggy hired Larry too. Most evenings, the pair would each do a solo set and then a set together. On a typical evening, the audience numbered 30-40 persons. 
Max and Sol Weiss, the owners of Fantasy Records, asked Odetta and Larry to make an album which they titled “Odetta and Larry” (originally a 10” LP and then expanded to a 12” LP, and eventually expanded into a CD). They recorded over several evenings. The songs that appeared on the album were chosen based on how well Odetta, Larry, the Weisses, and the audience liked each song. Altogether, Odetta and Larry performed at the Tin Angel for about 8 months.


== After the Tin Angel ==
The duo ceased playing together because Larry was drafted into the army, and was soon shipped to Bordeaux, France. By the time he returned to San Francisco from the army in 1956, the Tin Angel had folded. The duo reconnected and played several concerts in Berkeley, San Francisco and Los Angeles. 
The pair began growing in different directions as Odetta went on to an illustrious professional singing career and Larry went on to an accomplished academic career. He worked for the United States Public Health Service in Washington, D.C. for many years, went to graduate school, and eventually became a professor of Political Science at the University of Michigan.
""We remained friends and saw each other from time to time — not often,"" Larry said in 2012.

","William Jefferson Blythe Jr. (February 27, 1918 – May 17, 1946) was an Arkansas salesman of heavy equipment and the biological father of Bill Clinton, the 42nd president of the United States. Blythe died in a drowning following a car accident three months before his son was born.


== Personal life ==
William Jefferson Blythe Jr. was one of nine children born to William Jefferson Blythe Sr. (1884–1935), a farmer in Sherman, Texas, and his wife, the former Lou Birchie Ayers (1893–1946). Blythe Sr. was of English and Scottish descent, with a family tree in North America since the days of the thirteen colonies.Blythe was married five times. He married for the first time in December 1935 to Virginia Adele Gash; they were divorced only thirteen months later. Although no child was born to the couple during their marriage, they later had a son together. After the divorce, Virginia moved to California and married first a man named Coffelt, then a man named Charles Ritzenthaler. Blythe married his second wife 21-year-old Maxine Hamilton in August 1938, whom he divorced two weeks later. However, Virginia and Blythe remained friends, and she visited him on occasion. A son was conceived during these visits, and Henry Leon Blythe was born in Sherman, Texas in January 1938, eighteen months after his parents had been divorced. Henry's parents lost touch with each other when he was an infant, after William Jr. briefly married and divorced Virginia Gash's sister. He never knew his biological father or paternal siblings. Later in life, Henry Leon Blythe took the name Henry Leon Ritzenthaler in honor of his stepfather. Henry ran several small businesses in Paradise, California, including a janitorial business, dying in 2009. He was unaware of his connection to the future president until the presidential campaign of 1992, when an investigation by The Washington Post, based on birth registry records, revealed details of Bill Clinton's family. Ritzenthaler met his half-brother for the first time around that time, and the physical resemblance between the two was remarkable.Blythe next married Minnie Faye Gash, his first wife's sister, in December 1940. The marriage was annulled four months later in April 1941, without children. Shortly after the annulment on May 3, 1941, Blythe married again. His fourth wife was Wanetta Ellen Alexander of Kansas City, Missouri, and the wedding was held in Jackson County, Missouri. Wanetta gave birth to Blythe's daughter on May 11, 1941, eight days after their wedding. She had become pregnant with Blythe's child prior to his short-lived third marriage to Minnie. Sharon Lee Blythe Pettijohn is the daughter of Wanetta and Blythe, and is still alive in 2020. Blythe and Wanetta were formally divorced three years later, in April 1944, and lost touch immediately afterward. Wanetta, who eventually settled in Tucson, Arizona, had no inkling of Blythe's subsequent history until the presidential campaign of 1992 and a Washington Post story. Upon seeing old photographs of Bill Clinton's father flashed on TV, Wanetta ""swears on a stack of Bibles ... that that was the man she was married to"", said her son-in-law Bob Pettijohn, husband of her daughter Sharon.Blythe's divorce from Wanetta was granted in court on April 13, 1944. Seven months prior on September 4, 1943, Blythe had bigamously married Virginia Dell Cassidy of Bodcaw, Arkansas. Blythe and Virginia remained married until his death in a car crash on May 17, 1946. Three months after Blythe's death on August 19, 1946, Virginia gave birth to their only child, William Jefferson Blythe III. Bill, as a teen, took his stepfather's surname and became known as Bill Clinton, the future 42nd president of the United States. Virginia Blythe-Clinton had no knowledge of Blythe's previous marriages until decades later when The Washington Post ran an extensive story in 1993, based on birth and marriage registry records, to mark Father's Day.


== Career ==
Blythe was a traveling heavy equipment salesman for most of his brief career. It was while he worked as a travelling salesman that he met and married all his wives. After his fifth wedding in September 1943, Blythe shipped out for military service in World War II. He was stationed in Egypt and Italy. He worked in a motor pool as a mechanic, repairing jeeps and tanks. 
After the war ended, Blythe returned to Hope, Arkansas, to be with his wife. Shortly after he returned, he purchased a house in Chicago and readied it to receive his wife and expected child; he was apparently laying the ground for a more settled and conventional married life. Blythe moved to the new house in Chicago while Virginia remained behind in Hope. In Chicago, Blythe returned to his old job as a traveling salesman for the Manbee Equipment Company, which repaired heavy machinery. He died three months before the birth of his son.


== Death ==
On May 17, 1946, while traveling from Chicago, Illinois, to Hope, Arkansas, Blythe lost control of his 1942 Buick on U.S. Route 60 outside of Sikeston, Missouri, after one of his car's tires blew out. He survived the accident after being thrown from the car, but drowned in a drainage ditch as he tried to pull his way out of the three feet (1 meter) of water in the ditch. Three months later, Blythe's widow, Virginia, gave birth to their son, whom she named William Jefferson Blythe III in honor of his father and grandfather. In 1950, Blythe's widow married Roger Clinton Sr.; 12 years later, Blythe's posthumous son legally adopted his stepfather's surname. He has a granddaughter Chelsea Clinton, and 3 great-grandchildren.


== Memorial ==
Blythe was buried at Rose Hill Cemetery in Hope, Hempstead County, Arkansas. In 1994, Virginia was interred beside him. In Clinton's 2004 autobiography, My Life, the elder Blythe was extensively mentioned, including a visit that Clinton made to the site where his father drowned.

The event was attended by local and international members.


== History ==
In the early 1980s, Pastor Butch Conde originally wanted to start a halfway house for prostituted women in Olongapo City, where the U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay was located. In August 1982, 12 people including Pastor Conde started a new church in Loyola Heights, Quezon City. Maryknoll College (now Miriam College) offered its auditorium to launch the Bread of Life Christian Fellowship and the first service gathering was held on November 14, 1982. Attendance steadily increased.

In 1984, from a gathering of 120 members at Maryknoll College, weekly attendance climbed to a thousand, prompting BOL to temporarily move to the Philippine Heart Center in Quezon City on January 8 and 15, 1984. On January 22, BOL worship gatherings moved to Celebrity Sports Plaza in Capitol Hills, Quezon City in order to accommodate 1,200 members. Pastor Conde wanted to show that God provides for Filipino churches, and that Filipinos must break free from colonial mentality and become independent from foreign missionaries.After the People Power Revolution in 1986, Pastor Conde drew inspiration from his Korea Prayer Study Tour and Prayer Mountain experiences in South Korea. BOL then acquired a piece of land in the mountains in Antipolo, Rizal to build the country's and Southeast Asia's first Prayer Mountain facilities in 1988.On April 5, 1987, BOL services moved to Circle Theater (now Circle Events Place) located at Timog Avenue, and started to divide into four worship gatherings every Sunday. Between 1989 and 1991, it was one of the fastest-growing churches in the country with membership of up to 2,000 people in 1992. BOL then changed its name to Bread of Life Ministries. BOL also planted another central church in Makati, and had been planting church satellites nationwide.
In August 1993, BOL began building its own ministry center along Mother Ignacia Avenue in Quezon City. BOL is an indigenous church, built without foreign help, financial assistance, political support, or church partnership.In 1996, BOL started international outreach to Filipinos and other nationalities by founding BOL USA in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego, California. On November 29, 1998, the church dedicated Crossroad77 (now known as Crossroad Center) and weekly attendance averaged up to 2,500 each of the four service gatherings.In 2001, BOL Makati split into two centers and transferred its worship services from Mondragon building to a larger space. BOL Makati is now located on Glorietta 4 (G4), and Greenbelt Onstage, the latter located at the Project Mosaic, 3F Greenbelt 1, Ayala Center, Makati.

In 2002, BOL established the Meridian International Learning Experience, a multilingual Christian school.On November 25, 2007, BOL marked its 25th anniversary. The theme was the ""Global Village 25/25"", attended by thousands of members from BOL local and international outreaches. The celebration was held at Ynares Center, Antipolo, Rizal.


=== Bread of Life 30 Years ===
In 2012, Pastor Conde announced his retirement as senior pastor, having served as such for the past three decades. He now serves as the Pastor Emeritus of the church. On May 20, 2012, one of the associate pastors and head pastor of BOL Makati and Singapore, Rev. Noel Tan, was installed as the new senior pastor.BOL celebrated its 30th anniversary with the theme ""Perlas Ng Silangan: Bread of Life 30th Anniversary"". The celebration was held at the SMX Convention Center on November 18, 2012 with approximately 15,000 attendees from different BOL outreaches worldwide. In the same year, BOL Glorietta 4 in Makati was transferred to F1 Hotel in Bonifacio Global City, and eventually transferred its worship gatherings in SM Aura, Taguig. This was later named BOL BGC (known as Mosaic BGC).
In 2014, BOL Los Angeles acquired a property with an old church building in Glendale, California. It serves as the headquarters of Bread of Life in North America and Europe and has been named Pinnacle Village.


== Crossroad Center (Bread of Life Ministry Center) ==
Construction of the Crossroad Center (formerly Crossroad77) at Mother Ignacia Ave., Quezon City began in August 1993 and was completed in November 1998. It serves as BOL's international headquarters. Crossroad Center has five stories, two basement levels and two parking lots. It houses a 2,500-seat ""Convenarium"" for Sunday worship services and young adult ministries and a number of halls for other ministries covering different ages and life stages. Groups meet once a week for Bible study, fellowship and ministry work. The 3rd, 4th and 5th stories of the ministry center were also used as a community center which was supported by BOL.


== Core values ==
BOL's statement of faith includes its beliefs that:

The Holy Scriptures are the verbally inspired Word of God in its entirety, sixty-six books consisting of the Old and New Testaments, the final authority for faith and life.
There is one triune God, eternally existing in three Persons - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit - co-eternal in being, co-identical in nature, co-equal in power and glory, and having the same attributes and perfection.
Man's necessity to be born again, regenerated by the Holy Spirit, in which he is no longer conformed to the world's system but redirected to the things of the Spirit in order to be saved; and that the only way to salvation is to turn in genuine faith from the heart to Jesus Christ as personal Lord and Savior.
The Church, which is the body and espoused bride of Christ, is a spiritual organism made up of born-again persons, not any specific organization.
The great commission is the obligation of the saved to witness by life and by word to the truths of the Holy Scripture and to seek to proclaim the Gospel to all mankind.BOL's ongoing vision is to build a strong national uniqueness by becoming independent from foreign sources to rediscover Filipino Christian indigenous spirituality. BOL emphasizes the independence of the indigenous church and challenges other denominational churches to revive their identity through God's word as well. This belief is founded on the distinction which BOL applied to the uniqueness of the Christian journey by emphasizing the centrality of Christ, the foundation of Scriptures, prayer, and worship, operated by the power of God, the way of service through sacrifice and being people of faith.


== Congregations ==
BOL have established satellite outreaches locally and internationally. There are 11 satellite outreaches with weekly attendance of around 15,000 to 20,000 people within Metro Manila. Provincial congregations have a total of 20 satellite outreaches. BOL Crossroad Center, BOL Makati and BOL Cebu serve as the Philippines' central churches. Additionally there are 13 international outreaches in Asia, Australia, Europe, Middle East and North America. Pinnacle Village in Los Angeles serves as the North American and European central church.


== Multimedia and online church ==
In the 1990s, BOL sermons were broadcast on 702 DZAS-AM radio, but this has since been discontinued. In BOL USA, live streams and video archives of sermons were shown on its website.


== Controversy ==
On October 18, 2004, BOL released a paid advertisement in the Philippine Daily Inquirer entitled “Misplaced Priorities Can Mislead the Nation” as part of the Kingdom Of A Higher World series, written by then-BOL Pastor Bong Saquing. The article featured an eleven-year-old girl, Faye San Juan, who claimed to win in an “Intercontinental Science Quiz Net” in Australia. The story tells that Faye topped the contest with the support of the Japanese embassy and was not accompanied by the Philippine government. After further scrutiny in the media, BOL began an investigation about the backgrounds of the girl and the mother, and found the whole story a hoax created by Faye's mother who is mentally ill. BOL and Associate Pastor Jesmael M. Montaña (head of the Kingdom of a Higher World write-ups) issued a public apology to the media and cancelled the column.

Both countries share a special relationship, embedded in their shared history of colonial interactions for centuries. It began during the spice trade as the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies Company (VOC) trading post in what is now Indonesia, before colonising it as the Dutch East Indies until the mid 20th century. Indonesia was the largest former Dutch colony. In the early 21st century, the Dutch government has committed to boosting its relationship with Indonesia, noting that economic, political, and interpersonal contacts should be further strengthened.

","Indonesia and the Netherlands established diplomatic relations in 1949. Both countries share a special relationship, embedded in their shared history of colonial interactions for centuries. It began during the spice trade as the Netherlands established the Dutch East Indies Company (VOC) trading post in what is now Indonesia, before colonising it as the Dutch East Indies until the mid 20th century. Indonesia was the largest former Dutch colony. In the early 21st century, the Dutch government has committed to boosting its relationship with Indonesia, noting that economic, political, and interpersonal contacts should be further strengthened.


== History ==

In 1603, the VOC commenced operations in what is now Indonesia where it fought wars to expand its domain. Though Indonesian history featured other European colonial powers, it was the Dutch who solidified their hold on the archipelago. After VOC's bankruptcy in 1800, the Netherlands took control of the archipelago in 1826. Following this, they also fought against the natives and then enforced a period of forced labour and indentured servitude until 1870 when, in 1901, they adopted the ""Dutch Ethical Policy and Indonesian National Revival,"" which included a somewhat increased investment in indigenous education and modest political reforms. Only in the 20th century, however, was Dutch rule enhanced to what would become Indonesia. Following Japanese occupation during World War II, the Netherlands tried to re-establish their rule, amid a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle that ended in December 1949. International pressure then forced the Dutch to formally recognise Indonesian independence. In 1956, the government of Indonesia, led by Sukarno, cut off all diplomatic ties with the Netherlands, ties that were restored only in 1968 by the New Order government.


== High-level visit ==

In 1970, Indonesian President Soeharto paid an official visit to the Netherlands, which was reciprocated by Dutch Queen Juliana and Prince Bernhard royal visit to Indonesia in 1971. Queen Beatrix and Prince Claus also paid a royal visit to Indonesia in 1995. On 22 April 2016, President Joko Widodo paid an official visit to the Netherlands. On 10 March 2020, King Willem-Alexander paid a royal visit to Indonesia and made surprise apologies for excessive violence used during the early years of Indonesian independence.


== Political ties ==
Relations between the two have been marred by the separatist intentions of the West Papua Movement. Additionally, the Republik Maluku Selatan also seeks separation from Indonesia. In this vein, they have attacked targets in the Netherlands in the 1970s and 1980s, seeking to force the country to pressure Indonesia into allowing for the secession of their nation. Political ties were then strained as Indonesian officials refused to visit the Netherlands while the group was allowed to bring cases to court against them. However, the visit of the Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs Bernard Bot to Indonesia in 2005 to celebrate its 60th independence day anniversary was claimed by the Netherlands to have ""marked a[n] historic moment in the relations between the two countries. After this visit, the relations between Indonesia and the Netherlands was further intensified and strengthened by the extension of the cooperation in a wide range of fields.""In 2010, Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono cancelled a visit to the Netherlands after the group's activists asked a Dutch court to issue an arrest warrant for him. The move was condemned by pro-Indonesia Moluccan activists in Jakarta.


== Economy and trade ==

The Netherlands is one of Indonesia's most important trade partners in Europe. Trade between the two countries between January and September 2012 reached US$3.314 billion, while efforts are currently underway to further boost that figure. The Port of Rotterdam and Schiphol Airport have been the main entry points for Indonesian products into the European Union. Similarly, Dutch companies have seen Indonesia as their gateway to the larger ASEAN market, which is home to more than 500 million people.


=== Development assistance ===
For over 25 years, from 1966 to 1992, development assistance was provided by the Netherlands to Indonesia within the arrangements of the Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI). IGGI had been established in the late 1960s to help coordinate the flow of foreign aid to Indonesia and was convened and chaired by the Dutch government for over two decades throughout the 1970s and 1980s. However, in the early 1990s, the then-Minister for Development Cooperation in the Netherlands, Jan Pronk, became increasingly critical of domestic policy in Indonesia.  In response, in early 1992, the Indonesian government indicated that it no longer wished to participate in the annual IGGI meetings in The Hague and preferred that a new donor consultative group, the Consultative Group on Indonesia (CGI), be established and be chaired by the World Bank.  Initially, the Netherlands was not invited to attend CGI meetings. Later, the Netherlands became a member of the group.


== Military ties ==
The Indonesian military procures naval vessel from the Dutch, such as Van Speijk-class frigates and Sigma-class corvettes.


== Cultural relations ==

Traces of Dutch influences in Indonesia include Dutch origin loanwords in Indonesian and cuisine. Some Indonesian dishes have been adopted and, in turn, influenced Dutch cuisine. Though cultural relations are no longer strong, Christianity in Indonesia was a result of proselytisation by mainly Dutch missionaries. There is also a sizable Indonesian population in the Netherlands. Many have set up their own churches in what has been termed as a ""reverse mission,"" referring to the Dutch missionaries in the colonies.Another legacy of colonial rule in Indonesia is the legal system that was inherited from the Dutch. In 2009, the Dutch Minister of Justice Ernst Hirsch Ballin visited Indonesia in what some considered a stepping stone to reforming its legal system.Through centuries of colonial relations, numbers of cultural institutions in the Netherlands — such as Tropenmuseum and Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde in Leiden — has extensive collections of Indonesian archaeology and ethnology artefacts. Both are the leading centres of Indonesian studies in Europe, specialised in its culture, history, archaeology and ethnography. The Erasmus Huis — the Netherlands' cultural centre — was established in 1970 in Jakarta. It was meant as cultural cooperation to promote art and cultural exchanges between Indonesia and the Netherlands. Besides many exhibitions, music performances and films screenings, some lectures on Dutch and Indonesian culture are being held on a regular basis in their auditorium and gallery.

It was built in 1971 outside what was then the Brock Candles Inc. factory, which burned down in 1990. The land was formerly a dairy farm; factory owner Darrel Brock created the candle by covering a silo with 45,000 pounds (20 t) of red candle wax to advertise the factory.The candle was originally built with an actual wick. On May 9, 1971, the town's mayor and Oregon Governor Tom McCall lit the candle with a specially-made 60-foot-long match. President Richard Nixon declined a request to light the candle. Due to difficulties in keeping the candle lit during rainfall, the wick was replaced with a natural gas line up the center of the candle to create a real flame at the top. However, due to environmental concerns and high gas bills, the flame was eventually replaced with an electric neon light flame structure.The Peace Candle of the World was awarded the Guinness World Record for world's largest candle, but the record was later given to the 127-foot (39 m) wax candle that was featured at the General Art and Industrial Exhibition of Stockholm in 1897. The Scappoose Peace Candle sits on the east side of U.S. Route 30 and is visible from the highway. Each season the candle was re-coated with different colors to match the time of year, with red for Christmas and multiple colors being used in the fall. The wax around the candle was eventually replaced with more durable wax-like substances.The candle is meant to serve as a symbol for the desire for world peace. During the Christmas season the Scappoose Peace Candle is strewn with strands of Christmas lights.

It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1911. It is found on Mahé and Silhouette in the Seychelles.The wingspan is about 10 mm. The forewings are brown suffused with dark fuscous irroration (sprinkles) and with an oblique ochreous-white fascia towards the base, as well as an oblique whitish streak from the costa at one-third, running into a rather narrow somewhat curved whitish postmedian fascia, both these somewhat mixed with blue grey. The stigmata are indistinct, formed by blackish irroration, the discal approximated, the plical before the first discal, a curved white line running from the postmedian fascia around the upper edge of the first discal and then direct beyond the plical to the dorsum. There is a white spot on the costa at five-sixths, where a blue-grey line edged anteriorly with white and containing a blackish dot in the disc runs to the tornus.

Gunasekaran (born 3 June 1962) is an Indian Tamil politician and has twice been elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly of Tamil Nadu from the Manamadurai constituency.


== Personal life ==
Gunasekaran was born in Nelmadur on 3 June 1962. He has a BA degree and is married with three children.Gunasekaran lists agriculture as his occupation. A study comparing sworn election affidavits for members of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly who had won their seats in the 2006 elections and were standing as candidates in those of 2011 revealed that Gunasekaran had recorded the biggest percentage increase in assets. The increase was 3396 per cent.In June 2014, Gunasekaran was hospitalised, with police saying his condition was ""highly critical"", after being attacked by several people while talking with a group of friends in Manamadurai. Police said that the attack happened after a heated discussion with one of the attackers regarding property rights.


== Politics ==
Gunasekaran was first elected to the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly as an All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) candidate from Manamadurai constituency in the 2006 elections. The constituency is reserved for candidates from the Scheduled Castes. He was particularly active in asking questions in the house, raising 16,057 queries during the 13th Assembly, and was re-elected from the same constituency at the next election, in 2011.The elections of 2016 resulted in his constituency being won by the AIADMK's S. Mariappankennady, whom the party had determined should replace Gunasekaran.In January 2017, Gunasekaran announced that he could not work with the current AIADMK leadership, whom he said wanted to encourage dynastic politics. He had been a strong supporter of Jayalalithaa, the AIADMK leader and Chief Minister who had recently died, and preferred to support Deepa Jayakumar, Jayalalithaa's niece, in her bid to head the party. He said that he had been a supporter of AIADMK since 1987 and that his decision to favour Jayakumar's aspirations was backed by many thousands of AIADMK people in Sivaganga district, in which the Manamadurai constituency is situated. He felt the new leadership was being unfair in its allocation of party positions in the district.

Ishmouratova won the gold in the women's 15 km individual contest at the 2006 Winter Olympics.


== Biography ==
Svetlana Irekovna Ishmouratova was born in Zlatoust (Chelyabinsk region) . Her father Irek Ishmouratov, master in cross-country skiing, became her first coach. She started learning to ski when she was five and got her first medal when she was in the fourth form of a sports college. Svetlana did well at school though she didn't like studying very much. Initially, she didn't think about having a career in sports and even planned to study medicine after school. But then she decided not to leave her hometown, and rather keep studying and training there. Svetlana graduated Trade Secondary School of Zlatoust first and then State Academy of Physical Education.
In 1991, Ishmouratova became the USSR junior champion in individual race and the champion in senior team race. By the mid 90s she became a strong skilled athlete and entered the national Russian team, showing stable and good results in all kinds of competitions. But in 1996, she was mistakenly accused of doping and so was disqualified for two years (later the official apologies followed). That was the end of her skiing career.
But in autumn of 1996, Valentin Zadonski, a coach from Moscow, offered Svetlana to train with his women biathlon team. And in a year Svetlana became the champion of Russia and got a few medals in World Cup races. Despite her brilliant results, she was included in the National Olympic team only after some successful races in Italy not long before the Olympic Games in Nagano. Unfortunately, Svetlana got ill and didn't take part in the Winter Games of 1998. But in 2002 in Salt Lake City she became a bronze medalist in the relay. Besides, she has six World Champion titles (in summer and winter biathlon) and a lot of World Cup medals. Svetlana has been showing stable results for the last five years, reaching high positions in World Cup Total standings (10, 7, 11, 11, 12 places). Svetlana's coaches are V. Zadonski and A. Brylov. They say she is a kind and considerate person, a nice young lady with great will power and a strong character.
She doesn't like to speak about sports in her interviews. She speaks German and likes reading books during her leisure time. Her dream is to have a good loving family and children. She will probably work as a coach after finishing her sporting career. Her height is 165 cm and her weight is 57 kg.

In this battle the Russian corps under the command of Peter Wittgenstein stood up to the French corps under the command of Marshal Nicolas Oudinot with heavy losses on both sides.

The result was a minor Russian victory, their forces managing to capture the disputed village of Klyastitsy. The French partially retreated along their communication lines after the battle, and fended off Russian pursuers.


== The battle ==
On 29 July 12 French cavalry squadrons were surprised and attacked by eight Russian Hussar and Cossack squadrons under Gen. Yakov Kulnev.At that time Oudinot occupied the village of Klyastitsy on his advance towards St. Petersburg. There were 28,000 French troops, while the Russian Corps numbered 17,000. In spite of being outnumbered, Wittgenstein decided to fight. The battle started on 30 July at 2:00 pm. The Russian vanguard led by Kulnev (approximately 4,000 men) fought the French vanguard for the whole day near the village of Yakubov (Якубово). Kulnev managed to press the French but they kept the village under their control.The next day, after several attacks and counterattacks, the Russian advance forced Oudinot to retreat to Klyastitsy. In order to continue their advance, the Russian troops had to cross the River Nishcha. Oudinot ordered his troops to set fire to the only bridge. While the Russian cavalry was wading across the Nishcha, the 2nd Battalion of the Pavlovsk Grenadier Regiment rushed the burning bridge. This was depicted by Peter Hess in his painting, illustrated to the right.Kulnev continued to chase the French Corps with several cavalry regiments and one infantry battalion. After crossing the Drissa River on 1 August, his unit ran into an ambush and suffered heavy casualties from French artillery. Kulnev was badly wounded (he had both his legs severed by a cannonball) and died that same day. Oudinot retreated to Polotsk and the French advance on St. Petersburg failed.


== Aftermath ==
Wittgenstein was awarded the Order of St. George of the Second Degree. Alexander I is reported to have called him ""the savior of St. Petersburg"". Capt. Krylov, whose unit was the first to cross the river over the burning bridge, received the Order of St. George of the Fourth Degree.

Bacon is first mentioned as acting in the capacity of attorney to Queen Eleanor in 1278–9, and is described in certain indentures of the exchequer, dated 1288, as 'clericus Regis' and 'custos rotulorum et brevium de Banco' and 'Regis thesauriarius et camerarius,' his business being to keep a list of the cases argued in the common pleas, and to transmit records thereof, and also 'pedes chirographorum,' i.e. memoranda of fines levied throughout the country, to the treasurers and chamberlains of the exchequer, of the receipt of which the indentures already mentioned were acknowledgments. The 'chirographa,' or fines in question, were fictitious suits, by means of which it was the custom to bar entails and convey the landed property of married women.

In 1314 he was made one of the commissioners of oyer and terminer for the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk, to try certain assessors and collectors of the revenue charged with breach of trust.

== Early life ==
Fico was born on 15 September 1964, in the town of Topoľčany in the southwestern Nitra Region. His father, Ľudovit Fico, was a forklift operator, and his mother, Emilie Ficová, worked in a shoe store. He has two siblings; his brother Ladislav is a construction entrepreneur, and his sister Lucia Chabadová, who is fourteen years younger, is a prosecutor. Fico grew up and lived with his family in the village of Hrušovany, until the age of six, when they moved to the nearby town of Topoľčany.


=== Education ===
Fico has described his childhood ambitions as wanting to become either a politician, a sports reporter, or an archeologist.  After completing elementary school, he enrolled in the local Gymnasium of Topoľčany, graduating in the summer of 1982.  Later the same year he enrolled in the Law Faculty of the Comenius University in Bratislava, in what was then Czechoslovakia.  His teachers were impressed with him, and one of his teachers from university, the future prime minister Jozef Moravčík, described him as ""ambitious, very confident and very involved in discussions."" He graduated as juris doctor in 1986 specializing in criminal law.
After graduating from university, Fico completed his mandatory military service as an assistant military investigator, stationed in the (now-Czech) town of Janovice between 1986 and 1987. He later worked for the Institute of State and Law of the Slovak Academy of Sciences, as well as with the Justice Ministry until 1992. During this period he wrote and completed his PhD degree, with a thesis on ""The death penalty in Czechoslovakia."" In 2002 he completed his postgraduate study, earning him the title of associate professor.


== Early political career ==
Fico joined the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in 1986, having applied in 1984.  After the Velvet Revolution of 1989, and the collapse of the communist regime in Czechoslovakia, Fico joined the Party of the Democratic Left (SDĽ), a successor of the Communist Party of Slovakia.  He was first elected as a Member of Parliament in 1992. From 1994 to 2000 Fico represented Slovakia as its legal counsel at the European Court of Human Rights but lost all 14 cases which he handled. In 1998 he was elected deputy chairman of the party. Later the same year, Fico ran for the post of general prosecutor, but his party endorsed another candidate instead, arguing Fico was too young.In the 1998 elections that saw the fall of the government of Vladimír Mečiar, Fico received the biggest number of preferential votes among his party colleagues.  A year later, when support for the SDĽ dropped below the threshold required to get into parliament, he left the party, saying he was disappointed with the way the government worked. Fico acted as an independent MP until the 2002 elections.
As early as in the autumn of 1998, a four-person group consisting of Fico, his associate Frantisek Határ, political strategist Fedor Flašík, and media executive Monika Flašíková-Beňová had begun to discuss and lay plans for launching a new political party on the left.  These plans were driven by the falling popularity of the existing parties, and the rising popularity of Fico.Almost immediately after leaving SDĽ, the group founded Direction – Social Democracy (SMER), which Fico first labelled a party of the third way, with himself as leader.  Fico established himself as an opposition politician criticizing the unpopular reforms of the right-wing government of Mikuláš Dzurinda. In order to keep SMER from repeating the fate of his previous party, Fico introduced a strict set of regulations for his new party, called the ""clean hands"" policy.  The rules stipulated that no one with ties from the previous communist regime or people who had background with other political parties was allowed to hold party office.  This created a new generation of politicians uninvolved in previous corruption scandals; among them was Monika Flašíková-Beňová, Robert Kaliňák and Pavol Paška. Another rule was that all party chapters on the regional and local levels were to be 100% financially self-sufficient, and all financial donations were to be made public to the media.Between 2002 and 2006 Smer was the main opposition party in the Slovak parliament.  In 2004, it merged with nearly all the leftist parties active on the Slovak political scene, including its parent party SDĽ, becoming the dominant single political party in Slovakia.


== First term of Prime Minister: 2006–2010 ==

In the elections in 2006 SMER won with 29.1% of the votes. The election victory came after a campaign focused on reversing the deeply un-popular austerity reforms within the healthcare and education sectors, reforms which were pushed through by then ministers Rudolf Zajac and Martin Fronc. They subsequently formed a coalition government with Vladimír Mečiar's People's Party – Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and Ján Slota's Slovak National Party (SNS). SNS is a right-wing populist party which has been known for making anti-Roma and anti-Hungarian comments, including a drunken public speech of Ján Slota, in which he threatened to ""get in tanks and level Budapest to the ground.""One reaction to the coalition came from the EU-wide Party of European Socialists (PES), who suspended SMER's application to join the PES. In late February 2008, however, the Assembly of PES conditionally reinstated the application after both SMER and SNS signed a letter committing themselves to respect minority rights.Fico has never publicly condemned SNS's remarks and speeches, and government-level relations between Slovakia and Hungary deteriorated in his first term in office. Several meetings between the two countries' prime ministers were abruptly cancelled, and those few that did take place resulted in little improvement of relations.


== In opposition: 2010–12 ==

Before the 2010 elections, Fico's party was in a relatively strong position according to several polls. However, just before the election a political scandal broke out, described as one of the gravest in the country's 17-year history. A voice recording surfaced in which a voice strongly resembling that of Fico claims that he raised several million euros in undeclared funds for the 2002 election as well as calling for a ""parallel financial structure"" to be created for the financing of Smer's election campaign. Slovak media sources such as SME carried the news about the recording in great detail; however, Fico dismissed it as a forgery.Fico also attacked the media sources that published information about the recording, saying ""Should I go over there and give you a smack because you are scoundrels? What you are doing is unheard of. You are masturbating on the prime minister every day."" Fico has since been questioned on the matter, SME announced. Former Minister of Justice Daniel Lipšic told the press he has ""handed the recording to the general attorney office."" In the election, Fico's SMER remained the biggest party in Parliament, with 62 seats. However, his coalition partners were decimated, with the HZDS being completely shut out. Unable to find a partner willing to give him the 14 seats he needed to stay in office, Fico resigned. He said he ""respects the election result"" and expressed his desire to lead a resolute opposition after his narrow loss.


== Second term of Prime Minister: 2012–2018 ==


=== 2012 parliamentary election ===

Following the fall of the centre-right coalition government that replaced his, Fico's Smer-SD returned to power being the first party since the breakup of Czechoslovakia to win an absolute majority of seats. Fico initially sought to form a national unity government with SDKU or KDH, but when this failed he formed the first one-party government in Slovakia since 1993.


=== 2014 presidential election ===

On 18 December 2013, Fico officially announced his candidacy for the upcoming presidential election in 2014. ""I understand my candidacy as a service to Slovakia,"" Fico said on December 18. He argued that he did not see his candidacy as an adventure, an escape or an attempt to culminate his political career.
His campaign ran under the motto ""Ready for Slovakia."" On 9 January 2014, the Slovak Parliament, under Speaker Pavol Paška, officially approved the candidatures of Fico and 14 other candidates.However, Fico was defeated by the independent candidate Andrej Kiska, whose support from the right wing of Slovak politics led him to victory by a wide margin (approximately 59%–41%) in the second round of voting on 29 March 2014.


=== 2016 parliamentary election ===

Fico's party won the 2016 parliamentary elections, amassing a plurality of seats, but failed to win a majority. On 7 March 2016, President of Slovakia Andrej Kiska invited each elected party, with the exception of Kotleba – People's Party Our Slovakia, for post-election talks. Fico was given the first opportunity by the President to form a stable coalition. On 17 March, incumbent Fico informed president Andrej Kiska that he would form a four-party government coalition, including Smer–SD, the Slovak National Party, Most–Híd and Network, which together held 85 of the 150 seats.


=== Resignation ===

On 14 March 2018, Fico publicly stated that he was ready to tender his resignation as prime minister in order to avoid an early election as well as to ""solve the political crisis"" involving the murder of investigative journalist Ján Kuciak, who was writing stories on tax frauds and alleged cronies of the ruling party. Kuciak also examined the work of the Italian mafia 'Ndrangheta in Slovakia. According to the police, Mária Trošková, who is an assistant to Robert Fico, could have ties to 'Ndrangheta. Fico's announcement came after a meeting with President Kiska. In that meeting, Fico laid out a number of specific conditions that needed to be met by the president in order for him to resign. Those conditions were amongst others; that the result of the 2016 Slovak parliamentary election be respected, that the current ruling government coalition must continue, and lastly, that Smer-SD as the largest party currently in parliament name the next prime minister. Fico stated that he already had a candidate in mind; Slovak media widely reported that the next prime minister would be Deputy Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini. On 15 March, President Kiska formally accepted the resignation of prime minister Fico and his cabinet, and thereby tasked Pellegrini with forming a new government.


== Domestic policy ==
A large part of Fico's election victory in 2006 was attributed to his loud criticism of the previous right-wing government's economic, tax, social, pension and legislative reforms. The reforms were generally perceived as very positive and successful by such international bodies as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank or the OECD. However, the reforms negatively affected large segments of the population, particularly low wage earners, the unemployed, and welfare and other social assistance recipients. While in opposition, and more vocally during the election campaign, Fico vowed to reverse and cancel the majority of these reforms. However, upon taking office Fico adopted a more cautious approach, as he wanted to ensure Slovakia could fulfill the Maastricht criteria required for Euro currency adoption. This was successful, and Slovakia adopted the Euro on 1 January 2009.


=== Labour policies ===
Among the reforms Fico introduced, several established standards as to how many times employees could be kept on as temporary workers instead of being given permanent contracts. Under legislation of the Mikuláš Dzurinda government, an employer could keep new staff as temps and create a two-tier workforce, which many did. Slovakia's labor policies are now generally in tune with most other EU states.
At the start of his second term as Prime Minister in 2012, Fico introduced a new ""Labour Code,"" which granted entitlement to a lay-off notice period as well as severance pay, reduced overtime, making layoffs more expensive for employers, shorter temporary work contracts and more power for trade unions. In addition, it curbed the ‘chaining’ of fixed-term employment contracts, whereby currently it is possible to extend a fixed-term employment contract three times over three years. The Code was revised in 2014 when it introduced severe restrictions of the work on agreement performed outside regular employment. Under the latest revision, employers will be able to conclude agreements with employees for 12 months only.In 2010, Fico faced large-scale protests and a blockade of major cities by truckers upset about what they considered to be badly implemented tolls on the highways. Truckers demanded that fuel prices be lowered to compensate for the tolls. Fico initially refused to speak with representatives of the truckers, saying he would not ""be blackmailed"", but a few days later capitulated. The cuts given to truckers will amount to about €100,000,000.


=== Finance ===
One of few modifications Fico's government did implement was a slight modification to the unusual flat tax system introduced by the previous government, in a way that slightly decreased or eradicated a tax-free part of income for higher income earners. A lower value added tax was imposed on medications and books, though in spite of his election promises Fico failed to extend this onto a wider group of products such as groceries. Among the measures were controversial legislative changes which effectively banned private health insurance companies from generating profit. As a result, Slovakia is being sued by several foreign shareholders of local health insurers through international arbitrations. In 2007, Fico unsuccessfully tried to regulate retail food prices, an unprecedented effort in a generally free market European Union.In August 2008, Fico threatened the foreign shareholders of a local gas distributor SPP, the French Gaz de France and the German E.ON, with nationalization and seizure of their ownership shares in a dispute over retail gas prices.


== Foreign policy ==


=== European Union ===

In foreign relations with Europe, Fico's government faced controversies due to its affiliation with the internationally isolated parties of Vladimír Mečiar and Ján Slota. Under his leadership however, Slovakia entered the Eurozone in 2009, and Fico himself in a speech to the Oxford Union praised Slovakia's entry into the European Union as a ""success story."" Fico opposed the unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo, which he called a ""major mistake,"" as a result of which Slovakia has not recognised Kosovo as a sovereign state.Responding to the 2013 Euromaidan protests in Ukraine, Fico declared that the ""EU is no religious obligation"" as well as that the EU was ""so in love with itself"" that it is convinced there is no better alternative to it in the world. He subsequently condemned the use of violence, but acknowledged that the protests were an internal affair in Ukraine.Commenting on Brexit in November 2016, he stated that it wasn't clear what the United Kingdom wanted, adding that it ""must suffer"" more than the 27 countries who will remain in the bloc. He also stated that the UK will not be allowed to make EU workers ""second-class citizens"" while still receiving the benefits of the single market. In light of election of Donald Trump, he commented that it might spur Europe to bolster its military.In August 2017, Fico said: ""The fundamentals of my policy are being close to the (EU) core, close to France, to Germany. I am very much interested in regional cooperation within the Visegrad Four but Slovakia's vital interest is the EU.""


=== Immigration and Islam ===
Fico rejected European Commission's plan to distribute refugees and economic migrants from the Middle East and Africa among EU member states, saying: ""As long as I am prime minister, mandatory quotas will not be implemented on Slovak territory."" He has subsequently sought to associate refugees and Muslims with terrorism, claiming that ""thousands of terrorists and Islamic State fighters are entering Europe with migrants"" and stating that ""We monitor every single Muslim in Slovakia."" In May 2016, he stated that Slovakia will not accept ""one single Muslim"" migrant into the country, weeks before the country was scheduled to take over the presidency of EU. He further stated ""When I say something now, maybe it will seem strange, but I’m sorry, Islam has no place in Slovakia. I think it is the duty of politicians to talk about these things very clearly and openly. I do not wish there were tens of thousands of Muslims.""On 30 November 2016 The Slovak parliament under Fico government passed a bill that requires all religious movements and organizations to have a minimum of 50,000 verified practicing members in order to become state-recognized up from 20,000. it is wildly seen as toughens church registration rules to bar Islam.


=== Russia ===

Compensating for his lack of close political allies within the EU (the former head of the Czech Social Democratic Party, Jiří Paroubek, being a notable exception), Fico sought to strengthen relations with several non-EU countries such as Serbia and Russia. This broke with a pro-NATO, Western-focused trend established after the 1998 Slovak election.After coming to power in 2006, Fico declared that Slovakia's relations with Russia would improve after eight years of ""neglect."" Fico referred to ""Slavonic solidarity,"" which was a central theme of the Slovak National Awakening in the 1850s. On April 4, 2008, during a visit by Russian Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov, Fico said: ""In Slovakia, there have been efforts to deliberately ignore Slavonic solidarity."" Slovakia modernised Russian MiG fighters in Russia and did not buy new jets from the West. Additionally, Fico accused Georgia of provoking Russia when attacking South Ossetia in the 2008 Russia–Georgia war. Under his premiership, the Slovak foreign ministry rejected the Crimean referendum which incorporated Crimea into Russia. Fico himself, however, remained silent on the issue. Regarding the EU sanctions against Russia in 2014, Fico denounced them as ""senseless,"" and a ""threat to the Slovak economy.""


=== Hungary ===

Tension between Slovakia and Hungary, unstable from the past, was inflamed in 2006 following the parliamentary election and Fico's decision to include nationalist Ján Slota and his Slovak National Party into his governing coalition. Slota was known for his fierce anti-Hungarian rhetoric, including that ""Hungarians are a tumor on the Slovak nation that needs to be immediately removed."" In the wake of the election several incidents occurred which further inflamed nationalist sentiment on both sides, including the alleged beating of a Hungarian woman in South Slovakia. Fico reacted by condemning the extremism, but rebuked the Hungarian government by declaring ""The Slovak government doesn’t need to be called on to strike against extremism.""  The row heated up again in September 2007, when Fico's government introduced a law making the Beneš decrees inviolable. This was in response to demands from ethnic Hungarian politicians that compensations should be made to persons affected by the decrees.In May 2008, Fico labelled Hungary a potential threat during a speech commemorating the 161st anniversary of the day that Slovaks demanded national equality with other nations within the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy. Fico used the anniversary to openly criticise the political situation in Hungary and warn about the influence it might have on Slovakia. Especially he warned against the Hungarian right-wing politician Viktor Orbán, and his party Fidesz, which he called an ""extreme nationalist party."" Since then, however, relations between the two countries have slightly improved.


=== United States ===

Fico was a vocal opponent of the one-time planned construction of new U.S. anti-ballistic missile and radar systems in military bases in neighbouring Czech Republic and Poland and one of his first steps upon taking office was a military pullout from Iraq. In November 2013, Fico visited the U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington D.C., where they spoke about the US-Slovak partnership, which is ""based on shared democratic values and principles,"" after which he affirmed the strategic partnership between the two countries.


== Relationship with the media ==
During his press conferences he often verbally attacks, belittles and taunts the present journalists, often accusing them of bias and attacks on his government. On several occasions he has openly and on record used profanities against specific journalists (""idiots,"" ""pricks, ""prostitutes"", ""snakes"".). He has also been recorded ridiuling journalists' physical appearance. After characterising journalists as ""hyenas,"" the broadsheet Pravda adopted a hyena from Bratislava Zoo. In 2009, Fico repeatedly described the Slovak press as a ""new opposition force"" that was biased and was harming national and state interests. Fico also accused the press of failing to ""stand behind the common people.""Fico has upheld a long-running boycott of one of the major Slovak daily newspapers, SME. According to Fico, the boycott will last until it apologises for what he calls lies they published about him in the past, going as far as boycotting the main presidential debate prior to the 2014 presidential election, as it was co-hosted by SME.  As of November 2021 the boycott is still in place.Fico, on at least one occasion, issued an apology to a foreign politician whose visit to Slovakia was largely ignored by the media. When Russian Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov visited in April 2008, most media did not consider the visit of the virtually unknown Zubkov substantially newsworthy. To make matters worse, during the press conference the journalists were not allowed to ask any questions. Subsequently, Fico sent Zubkov a letter of apology in which he apologized for the Slovak media's lack of interest in his visit.In July 2012 Fico declared ""Eternal Peace"" between him and the Slovak press. He also stated his desire to change his attitude towards the media, saying ""I think it is enough"" and that he does not plan any further lawsuits against media outlets except in extraordinary situations. Fico further said: ""You have to spend an incredible amount of energy on it [lawsuits], it means several years of conflict, one conflict takes usually five or six years [to resolve],"" adding that lawsuits involve ""legal fees, paying a lawyer, everything around that."" In November 2016, he termed journalists questioning him about allegations of public procurement rules during Slovakia's EU presidency, as ""dirty, anti-Slovak prostitutes."" He also claimed the accusations were a targeted attack to smear the country's presidency of EU.


== Personal life ==
Fico is married to Svetlana Ficová (née Svobodová), a lawyer and associate professor from Žilina. They were classmates while both were studying law at the Comenius University in Bratislava, and they married in 1988. They have one son together, Michal, who studied at the University of Economics in Bratislava. In addition to his native Slovak, Fico speaks fluent Czech, English and Russian.


=== Religion ===
Fico has rarely discussed in public his religious life. In his application to join the Communist Party in 1984, Fico stated that he was ""strictly atheistic,"" as was required in order to be accepted. According to the testimonial from college added to the application, he held a ""scientific Marxist-Leninist worldview"" and ""no problems with regards to religion.""In a promotional video during presidential election campaign in 2014, Fico said he grew up in a Roman Catholic family and that he considers himself a Catholic. He discussed his baptism, holy communion, confirmation and how the Catholic faith had impacted his childhood. He stated: ""Perhaps if I am to do my profile in relation to the Catholic Church, I would end up better off than any MP of the KDH."" He also described growing up with his grandfather, a man who ""very strictly respected the rules of standard Christian life,"" stating that it profoundly impacted him. However, historian and former researcher of the National Memory Institute Patrik Dubovský consider it being an attempt to manipulate public opinion, because ""confirmation was in direct conflict with Communist Party membership, which political programme was based on atheism."" As Dubovský stated, religiously active people were severely persecuted, especially after the Charta 77 incident.During televised debate Fico refused to answer a television presenter's question about whether he is a Christian (Catholic) or an Atheist, and said that he considered it a private matter. Regarding his baptism, holy communion and confirmation, Fico said that he was baptised as an infant and the holy communion with confirmation followed afterwards, as it was with every child who grew up in his home village, according to him.


=== Alleged extramarital affairs ===
In August 2010, Fico was photographed around midnight in a gay bar in downtown Bratislava together with a woman, who was later revealed to be 25-year-old Jana Halászová, a secretary at the Smer-SD party headquarters. It was later revealed that Halászová had been given extensive privileges, including her own parking space in the Parliament car park, without being a member. Halászová had also bought a luxurious car worth around €30,000 and bought a new flat without a mortgage in August 2012 in a neighbourhood where a one-room flat costs approximately €100,000, despite being a secretary without education. In addition, both her sister and step-mother had recently been given jobs within various ministries.In August 2013, Fico was photographed while embracing and kissing his now-secretary Halászová, after taking her for a private dinner at a chateau in Čereňany, 160 kilometres from Bratislava.  The photos created another round of speculation about the true nature of their relationship as well as whether or not he had used public funds to pay for the dinner. A month later, the tabloid 7 Plus reported that Fico and Halászová had been photographed together in a luxury restaurant while vacationing together in the Croatian town of Opatija. In response to this latest story, Fico filed a defamation lawsuit against 7 Plus magazine.In March 2018, after murder of Jan Kuciak, Slovak investigative journalist Eugen Korda in interview for public Česká televize TV alleged that Mária Trošková, Fico's assistant, is also his lover. Trošková escorted Fico on multiple high-level diplomatic meetings, including a summit with Angela Merkel.Subsequently, direct connection between Mária Trošková and convicted 'Ndrangheta member Antonino Vadala was revealed by the press. While her romantic connection to Fico was not confirmed, her former relationship with Vadala was. Despite the evidence Fico was publicly supporting Trošková and the secretary of the Security Council Viliam Jasaň. After the public outrage, Trošková abandoned her position as State Counsellor and Fico's assistant and disappeared from the public eye.

It has also been introduced to Latin America, the Caribbean, and the southeastern United States. It is a highly flammable fire-adapted species, and can spread rapidly by colonizing disturbed areas and encouraging more frequent wildfires.","Imperata cylindrica (commonly known as cogongrass  or kunai grass ) is a species of perennial rhizomatous grass native to tropical and subtropical Asia, Micronesia, Melanesia, Australia, Africa, and southern Europe. It has also been introduced to Latin America, the Caribbean, and the southeastern United States. It is a highly flammable fire-adapted species, and can spread rapidly by colonizing disturbed areas and encouraging more frequent wildfires.


== Common names ==

The species is most commonly known in English as ""cogongrass"",  from Spanish cogón, from the Tagalog and Visayan kugon. Other common names in English include  kunai grass, blady grass, satintail, spear grass, sword grass, thatch grass, alang-alang, lalang grass, cotton wool grass, and kura-kura , among other names.


== Description ==
It grows from 0.6 to 3 m (2 to 10 feet) tall. The leaves are about 2 cm wide near the base of the plant and narrow to a sharp point at the top; the margins are finely toothed and are embedded with sharp silica crystals. The main vein is a lighter colour than the rest of the leaf and tends to be nearer to one side of the leaf. The upper surface is hairy near the base of the plant while the underside is usually hairless.Cogongrass has an extensive rhizome network, the biomass of which accounts for 60% of the total biomass of the plant. They can penetrate up to 1.2 m (3.9 ft) deep, but 0.4 m (1.3 ft) is typical in sandy soil.


== Flammability ==

Cogongrass is a fire-adapted species. It is highly flammable, even when still apparently green, particularly in tropical climates. It is not uncommon to see hillsides of cogongrass on fire. Cogongrass depends on regular fires to spread and maintain ecological dominance. Because of its density and high biomass, cogongrass provides a very high fuel load, enabling wildfires to burn faster, higher, and much hotter. This is hot enough to kill most competing plants, including trees. After a fire, cogongrass will recolonize the area using their rhizome network which was unaffected by the fire.A common expression in the Philippines is ningas cogon ('cogon brush fire'). It is a figure of speech for procrastination, specifically people who show a fervent interest in a new project but lose interest quickly, in reference to the propensity of cogongrass to catch fire and burn out quickly.


== Phytochemistry ==
The plant contains the triterpenoids arundoin, cylindrin and fernenol.


== Cultivation and uses ==

It is used for thatching the roofs of traditional homes throughout south-east Asia.

It is planted extensively for ground cover and soil stabilization near beach areas and other areas subject to erosion. Other uses include paper-making, thatching and weaving into mats and bags. It is used in traditional Chinese medicine.A number of cultivars have been selected for garden use as ornamental plants, including the red-leaved 'Red Baron', also known as Japanese blood grass.
Young inflorescences and shoots may be eaten cooked, and the roots contain starch and sugars and are therefore easy to chew.It is used as an ingredient in the skincare brand Kiehl's Ultra Facial Cream for its high concentrations of potassium which provides a hydrating effect. Their website also states that indigenous native Australians may have used the plant as a substitute for salt due to its high saline content.


=== Weed problems ===
The plant has become naturalized in the Americas, Northern Asia, Europe and Africa in addition to many islands and is listed as an invasive weed in some areas. In the U.S. it survives best in the Southeast (and, according to a 2003 survey, has overtaken more acreage in that region than the notorious kudzu), but has been reported to exist as far north as West Virginia and Oregon. Worldwide it has been observed from 45°N to 45°S. It grows on wet lands, dry lands, areas of high salinity, organic soils, clay soils, and sandy soils of pH from 4.0 to 7.5. It prefers full sun but will tolerate some shade. In Florida, I. cylindrica is found in areas where the soil has been disturbed, such as roadsides, building sites, timber harvesting areas, and borrow pits. It is able to invade both moist and dry upland pine forests. Once established it often forms dense monocultures.In addition to outcompeting species for resources, the grass also exhibits allelopathic tendencies. The chemicals it releases as well as the dense mat of vegetation that usually accompanies a cogongrass invasion gives it an advantage over indigenous plants.It spreads both through small seeds, which are easily carried by the wind, and rhizomes which can be transported by tilling equipment and in soil transport.
In the Southeastern United States, state governments have various eradication efforts in place, and deliberate propagation is prohibited by some authorities. Cogongrass came to the Southeastern United States in the early 1900s as shipping material in crates. Before it was named an invasive species in the area, it was cultivated for fodder for livestock and erosion control. It failed to prevent erosion because of how weedy it was, and animals would not eat it as fodder. It is now listed as a Federal Noxious Weed in some Southeastern States and Arkansas. In Mississippi it is mostly concentrated in the south of the state.Control is typically by the use of herbicides. Currently, the most effective herbicides used to control growth are glyphosate and imazapyr. Burnoff is seldom successful since the grass burns at a high temperature, causing heat damage to trees which would ordinarily be undamaged by a controlled burn; it also recovers from a burn quickly. Quarantine and extermination of this plant is especially difficult because cogongrass establishes root systems as deep as four feet, and regrowth can be triggered by rhizome segments as small as one inch.Cogongrass is difficult to contain mainly because it is highly adaptive to harsher environments, establishing itself on soils low in fertility. The grass can also grow on sand and clay. It is not eaten by many species of animal, further contributing to containment difficulties. The grass tends to be averse to dense shade, but reports indicate more shade-tolerant strains are developing.The legume vine Mucuna pruriens is used in the countries of Benin and Vietnam as a biological control for Imperata cylindrica.


== Taxonomy ==
Imperata cylindrica was first described by Linnaeus in 1759 under the basionym Lagurus cylindricus. They were renamed by the French entomologist and botanist Palisot de Beauvois to the current accepted name of Imperata cylindrica.

Roth modeled it after New York's Village Voice and papers he had seen in Boston, but with one important difference: the Reader was free, distributed at bookstores, bars and shops. At the time, free circulation was disreputable. Roth, who was president of the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies from 1983 to 1987, proselytized for the free model and, as the Reader prospered, papers in other cities began to adopt it. By 1996, when the Village Voice converted to free circulation, the entire industry had followed the Reader's lead.Roth was publisher of the Reader from 1971 to 1994, editor and publisher from 1975 to 1990, and president of the company until it was sold in 2007. In addition he was president of the company that published Washington City Paper, which was owned by the same group and also sold in 2007. Since then Roth has been president of Quarterfold, Inc., which holds former Reader assets not transferred in the sale, including an interest in Index Newspapers, the company that publishes The Stranger of Seattle and the Portland Mercury in Oregon.Roth began collecting art in the mid-1980s. By 2005, his collection comprised more than 1,000 pieces, most by untrained artists such as Henry Darger, Steve Ashby and Sam Doyle.

Roth modeled it after New York's Village Voice and papers he had seen in Boston, but with one important difference: the Reader was free, distributed at bookstores, bars and shops. At the time, free circulation was disreputable. Roth, who was president of the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies from 1983 to 1987, proselytized for the free model and, as the Reader prospered, papers in other cities began to adopt it. By 1996, when the Village Voice converted to free circulation, the entire industry had followed the Reader's lead.Roth was publisher of the Reader from 1971 to 1994, editor and publisher from 1975 to 1990, and president of the company until it was sold in 2007. In addition he was president of the company that published Washington City Paper, which was owned by the same group and also sold in 2007. Since then Roth has been president of Quarterfold, Inc., which holds former Reader assets not transferred in the sale, including an interest in Index Newspapers, the company that publishes The Stranger of Seattle and the Portland Mercury in Oregon.Roth began collecting art in the mid-1980s. By 2005, his collection comprised more than 1,000 pieces, most by untrained artists such as Henry Darger, Steve Ashby and Sam Doyle. In 2008, he was named in Arts & Antiques magazine’s list of 250 ""Top Collectors"". He was president of Intuit (see above) from 1991 to 1996 and remains on the board of directors. The museum's Robert A. Roth Study Center is named in his honor. He is also a director and the principal owner of Raw Vision, the international journal of outsider art, based in London.

== History ==

There were two sets of barracks in Waterford: the infantry barracks on the North side of Barrack Street and the artillery barracks on the South side. It is not known when the infantry barracks were established but it is accepted that the artillery barracks were built in the aftermath of the Irish Rebellion and completed at the end of the 18th century. During the First World War the artillery barracks, at that time known as the cavalry barracks, served as the 1st cavalry depot providing accommodation for the 5th Royal Irish Lancers, the 9th Queen's Royal Lancers, the 12th Royal Lancers, the 16th The Queen's Lancers, the 17th Lancers and the 21st Lancers.During the Irish Civil War the barracks were seized by the anti-treaty forces; however in the ensuing battle there were many direct hits from gunfire. By the end of the Irish Civil War the infantry barracks were in a very dilapidated state and the artillery barracks had been largely destroyed when a direct hit exploded in the magazine. The artillery barracks were gone by the 1930s and were replaced by St. Carthage's Avenue.

","The Anglican Church of the Holy Trinity, Binegar, Somerset, England is Norman but has been rebuilt and restored several times since. It is a Grade II* listed building.


== History ==
The original church was Norman however it was largely rebuilt in the 15th century with just the original tower remaining. A Victorian restoration was carried out in 1858.The need for ongoing maintenance of the joists of the floor and slates on the roof mean the building has been added to the Heritage at Risk Register.The parish is part of the benefice of Ashwick with Oakhill and Binegar, which is within the Diocese of Bath and Wells.


== Architecture ==
The stone building has an asbestos slate roof. It consists of a three-bay nave, two-bay chancel and north transept, with an organ chamber, vestry and porch. The three-stage tower is supported by diagonal buttresses. In 1937 three new bells were added in the tower.Inside the church is a 15th-century font and Jacobean altar table. There is a white marble tablet in the church which is a memorial to men from Binegar who died in World War I and a second for the fatalities of World War II.

== Background ==
Redwood Curtain was filmed in Northern California.  The film was adapted by Ed Namzug and based upon Lanford Wilson's 1993 play of the same name.  Hallmark brought Debra Monk, who was part of the original stage production, to the telefilm to reprise her role of Geneva Riordan.

== Party Manifesto ==
The Philosophy of Nationhood
The “good life” of the Filipino Malays in the Philippines is an objective that must be pursued, clearly by the enterprise unit that is the nation, establishment and sustenance of which must be the subject of a sacred covenant.

The nation, like an individual, has body and spirit... the body manifested by the endowments of the country and its people, while the spirit is manifested by the faith, the morality and the values of the nation.
The nation is inspired by the intentions and plans of God the Father, guided by ways Christ has shown us, and sustained by the caring for, and of, our fellowmen that the Holy Spirit has enabled us.The Covenant of Leadership
The Social Covenant

The Philippines is a nation made up of a country well blessed with bountiful and beautiful natural resources, and a kind of people capable of protecting, sustaining and making the country more productive, and naturally deserving of the benefits of such blessings.
The quality of physical health (life), the depth and breadth of education (liberty), and the morality of our options in the pursuit of happiness, describe the kind of society we have established. Malays to gain and sustain freedom.
Nation building, as in community building is largely a phenomenon of the dependence or reliance on one another, which is a function of such value as honesty that should be developed among the stakeholders.
Empowering the Filipino Malay society shall require the provision of opportunities to enable them to participate in the socio-political and socio-economic spheres of engagement and decision-making processes.The Economic Covenant
To protect, promote, advance, sustain and enjoy such endowments, the economic philosophies we live by are:

The Filipino Malays must be the foremost determinant of the economy so that they may become the principal beneficiaries thereof.
The nation's production capability and capacity are the most important measures of economic progress and development.
Rational sourcing of inputs and equitable distribution of outputs help the economy grow faster, as in optimizing employment with which the sharing of economic activities is optimized.
Consumption of the people within the country is supposed to be equal to the production of the people in the country, and one must function as effective stimulus of the other.
Real economic progress of the nation is best measured through the strength of its economic powerbases – the regions, cities, municipalities and the barangays.The Political Covenant

The stakeholders of the national enterprise, invariably referred to as the citizens, in the exercise of their sovereignty, have to commit to duties and responsibilities before they can claim for rights and privileges.
The political power structure of a truly democratic government is one that is sustained and inspired by the values and inspirations of the dominant class of the citizenry.
The political order must ensure that vision driven, moral, and competent stakeholders appreciate the need to provide leadership in government.
The strength of a nation lies on the capacities and capabilities of all its governing units – serving as the foundation of the state.


== Party Principles ==
Filipinos must be the sole determinants of Philippine economy, so that they become the principal beneficiaries of the fruits of development. One decides invariably for one's benefit. Filipinos should benefit from the gain of the Philippine economy; in like manner, they will also suffer from the dysfunctions and retrogression of the economy.
While the Philippine economy needs to reckon with developments in the globalized economic order, it must aggressively protect and promote the resources and advantages of Filipinos in this economic environment (liberation and low-wage policy reversed).
Let us show aversion to multinational efforts to increase the world economic pie. We can participate in and identify the moves and opportunities that the Philippine economy can tale advantage of. Let us put Filipino priorities above the interest of other nations, while extracting from them that which will benefit Filipino enterprise.
Guided free enterprise will rationalize the production, distribution and consumption factors of the economy. Truly, a democratic-capitalistic environment is still the best propellant of Filipino creativity, initiative and productivity. Collective social intervention by a moral government will indeed help direct the economy towards productivity that greatly benefits the most.
The nation's production capability and capacity are the true measures of economic progress and development. The productivity of any enterprise, family or nation, is essentially measured by the willingness of the unit to work hard and exert effort. Productivity if not attained by luck or by clever wheeling-dealing, nor by dependence in the generosity of another enterprise.
Industry is a value or virtue to be developed and sustained, not only among individuals, but also for national society. Civilization has come a long way. The sustenance of the good life is not dependent only on natural resources and God's endowments. It is also generated by man's efforts and capabilities to provide products and services that help lead to a better quality of life.
The nation cares more for economic activities that rely on one and/or are supportive of another within the country (upstream-downstream, input-output, agro-industry). Building a nation's economy is the result  of widening network of economically complementary activities. Agriculture and industry can co-exist in a symbiotic manner. In the same way, big and small businesses can have mutually rewarding relationships.
Rational sourcing of inputs and equitable distribution of outputs help the economy grow faster, as in expanding employment and productive activities that broaden the sharing of the economic pie. The economy progresses most rapidly when activities are undertaken by the broadest constituency of the enterprise unit, both by contributing to inputs and by sharing in the outputs.
Industry is a value or virtue to be developed and sustained, not only among individuals but for national society specifically. The production of more people in the national economic enterprise helps hasten the achievement and broadens the scale of progress and development. Providing employment to as many people as possible is one way of opening more doors to stakeholder involvement. Conversely, raising productivity through the capital of a few oligarchs does not generate the desired progress.
Productivity that propels the desired economic development is what which results from production that leads to ever-growing links enterprise building. Optimizing productivity is achieved by prioritizing the production of tolls and machinery that are used in producing more goods. For example, manufacturing a tractor that will consequently prepare the soil for plating agricultural products is definitely more beneficial than producing carbonated and junk foods of equal value.
Rational distribution of inputs and outputs includes the propriety of vertical allocation of inputs and outputs of every participant in the national enterprise. What is cost to a consumer is income to a supplier, who in turn will be a consumer of another supplier. This consumption-supply chain optimizes benefits produced to both players.
Consumption of people within the country is supposed to be equal to the production of people in the country. One must function as an effective stimulus of the other. Consumption in the country should stimulate production within the country as well. The cost of consumption should be the income of production. Consumption by Filipinos that results in income for non-Filipinos, should be discouraged.
To stimulate production, consumption needs to be disciplined to be consistent with the social covenant, particularly as we reckon with the needs of succeeding generations. The Philippines is largely an agricultural country blessed by God and nature's endowments. Filipinos must utilize the framework of sustainable development in addressing the people's basic economic needs and in developing the national economy, while concomitantly protecting and preserving the resources of succeeding generations.
Consumption is properly deserved to the extent to which one has contributed to production. Those who produce wealth of the economy, by the principal of social equity, deserve to enjoy the fruits of their hard labor. What one has sown will be reaped by no other than oneself. Because each and everyone of the citizenry is considered a stakeholder of the nation as an enterprise unit, their collective endeavor serves the single concern of uplifting the economy and developing the nation.


== Party slogan ==
The party's main slogan is economic protectionism and national industrialization - its primary economic agenda to support homegrown industries in the Philippines.


== Platform of government ==
The leadership of NEPA in 2010, decided to re-invigorate both the movement and the party as a parallel organization. It adopted a two-point program:
Macroeconomic review

The party intends to review and redefine the Philippines macroeconomic policy environment by identifying the inspiring philosophies, and strategizing actions for “quick win.” The primary target is national industrialization through the identification of key policies pertaining to key industries where the country has abundant raw materials, manpower and capital to support its development. For instance, the aviation sector and its line industries has plenty of potential for generating jobs for the Philippines, yet it is one of the most neglected sectors in the economy in terms of policy support system. Aviation, particularly its two line industries - airline and airport industries, are support system to the tourism sector and its allied industries. The party proposes a synergy of industrialization in both sectors to trigger developments on the other.Small Filipino enterprise strengthening. Determine how small and medium Filipino enterprises can be made to play a bigger role in economic development. Resolve how they can helped to grow faster, while making vital advocates of economic nationalism.


== Alliances ==
As the party is building and strengthening its organizational structure, it is collaborating through linkages with minor party-lists and non-government organizations, people's organizations, community associations, transport organizations and fraternal organizations.
As a parallel, its social arm, the NEPA is collaborating with government agencies in the country serving as conduit for local government units in the provision of government services.


== 2013 Elections ==
The Malay Democrats of the Philippines plans to take part in the 2013 local elections either by directly fielding candidates or supporting candidates supportive of the Party's principles and platform. Initially, Malay Democrats of the Philippines plans to make its presence felt in Region III, Region IV-A, Region VI and the National Capital Region.


== 2016 Elections ==
The Malay Democrats of the Philippines supported the presidential campaign of Senator Grace Poe by focusing on grassroots organizing which generated more than 500,000 card bearing members nationwide.

== Proposal ==
The Chuitna Coal Project is a proposal of PacRim LP, a Delaware-based corporation owned by the Texas-based energy company Petro-Hunt LLC.  PacRim holds a state lease to 20,571 acres (83.2 km2) of Alaska Mental Health Trust property where an estimated 1 billion metric tons of low-sulfur, sub-bituminous coal is thought to exist. Proven reserves are reported to be 771 million tons. The company is in the advanced stages of state and federal mine-permitting processes. PacRim has surveyed three Logical Mining Units, or LMUs, within its lease. If permitted, the company has said it plans to extract up to 12 million metric tons of coal from the first of these units over a minimum period of 25 years. Other LMUs, could be developed in future years.
The surface coalmine itself could eventually spread to cover 30 square miles (78 km2), but the project also would include assorted support facilities, a mine road and a 12 miles (19 km) long, covered conveyor system to transport coal to Cook Inlet at Ladd Landing where a port facility would be built. Ladd Landing is property owned by the Kenai Peninsula Borough and subject to a lease-option held by PacRim. A letter of intent to exercise the Ladd Landing option was filed by PacRim in March, 2009. For more, see Lease-Option History section below.
Only about 10 percent of Alaska's electricity is generated by coal, all of which is produced by the Usibelli Coal Mine, near Healy, Alaska. That operation supplies six Interior Alaska power plants and ships its surplus overseas. Currently, Alaska's coal-fired generating capacity has no need for the coal that would be produced at Chuitna. Thus, coal extracted from the Chuitna project would most likely be shipped to Asian markets, including South Korea, Japan and Mainland China, with other possible markets being Mexico and Chile.Interest in exploiting the resources in the Beluga Coal Fields has waxed and waned over the decades since the late 1960s, with the lease passing through a succession of corporate hands. The proposed Chuitna Coal Project has both proponents and opponents and is becoming increasingly controversial in the Cook Inlet region.


=== Geography ===
The proposed Chuitna Coal Project mine site is located within PacRim's lease area designated as follows: Sec 14, 15, 21-28 and 33-36, T13N, R12W, Seward Meridian.


=== Land ownership ===
Land within and around PacRim's lease area is owned by a variety of entities, including the State of Alaska, the Alaska Mental Health Trust Authority, the Kenai Peninsula Borough, the Tyonek Native Corp., Cook Inlet Region, Inc. (CIRI), and private owners. The state of Alaska owns about 132,500 acres (536 km2) (including mental health lands), and coal leases have been issued on some 46,000 acres (190 km2), including the 20,571 acres (83.2 km2) leased to PacRim. Two state wildlife refuges are near the project zone. They are the Susitna Flats Wildlife Refuge to the northeast, and the Trading Bay Wildlife Refuge to the southwest. According to the state, neither would be affected by the mining project. Tyonek Native Corp. owns more than 40,000 acres (160 km2) to the southeast. CIRI owns a scattering of properties around the mine site. The Kenai Peninsula Borough owns 16,800 acres (68 km2) south of the mine lease boundary and a small area of land around Beluga and Ladd Landing. Private land is mostly along the Cook Inlet coastline in Beluga, Tyonek, as well as at North Forelands and south of Granite Point, which are coastal locations south of Tyonek.


=== Lease-option history ===
The Kenai Peninsula Borough-PacRim Ladd Landing lease-option document shows that in 1987, the borough entered a lease-option agreement with Tidewater Services Corp, which merged with Midgard Energy Co., in 1994. That year, Midgard assigned its option to Richard Bass, William Herbert Hunt, and William Herbert Hunt Trust Estate. The option was extended multiple times through years while coal mining in the state lease area remained financially impractical. Early in 2008, Bass, Hunt and the Hunt Trust Estate assigned the Ladd Landing option to PacRim Coal LP. In March 2009, PacRim signed a letter of intent to exercise its Ladd Landing option. As of April 2009, the Kenai Peninsula Borough's Land Management Office had begun the process of bringing that lease to closing under the existing 1987 terms, a process that had to be completed within 180 days. According to borough officials, the two sides will renegotiate terms they have mutually agreed are outdated and in need of revision.


=== Access ===
No roads connect the project area to Alaska's highway system. The areas is accessible only by sea and air. Airstrips exist at Beluga and Tyonek. PacRim proposes to build a third airstrip in the project area. ConocoPhillips has a private strip south of the Beluga Power Plant. Gravel roads connect Tyonek and Beluga, and there are remnants of old roads used for logging, oil, gas and coal exploration efforts. Barge landing areas exist at Ladd Landing, Tyonek and Granite Point, and are used to supply local residents.


=== Risks and rewards of development ===
RisksExtracting coal from the Beluga Coal Fields is an idea decades old, but several factors have so far discouraged construction, including the costs associated with developing a mine, the market price of coal, the lack of demand for coal in Alaska, among others. In recent years, opposition to mining the fields has grown, specifically with respect to PacRim's Chuitna Coal Project, the project most advanced in state and federal permitting processes. Many Alaskans, including fisheries biologists, are voicing opposition because of the mine's proposed location amid environmentally important wetlands and because of the nature of coal itself.  Critics charge that development would devastate more than 30 square miles (78 km2) of critical wildlife habitat and destroy 11 miles (18 km) of salmon spawning streams. There is no precedent in Alaska for permitting mining in active salmon streams, and no guarantee that post-mine mitigation would restore the ecosystems. Chuitna would be the first if permits were granted. Regarding coal itself, the U.S. has about a quarter of the world's reserves; it has been called the Saudi Arabia of coal. U.S. coal-fired power plants generate roughly half the nation's electricity, according to the United States Department of Energy. But coal is problematic. It is dirtiest of fossil fuels, and burning it produces a third of the nation's carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas contributing to climate change.
Because of PacRim's proposal, the non-profit organization American Rivers named the Chuitna one of America's 10 ""Most Endangered Rivers"" in 2007 and again in 2015.
RewardsChuitna's developers predict mine construction and operation will produce between 300 and 350 good-paying jobs, and royalties to the state upwards of $350 million over the 25-year lifespan of the first Logical Mining Unit project. PacRim also expects numerous service contracts with the local business community. PacRim will develop Ladd Landing as a port (see above) for loading large vessels that would transport the coal to Asian markets. That port could be important for the future development of public and private property on the west side of Cook Inlet. The 300 million tons PacRim expects to excavate from its Chuitna mine is thought to equal two-thirds of the total recoverable coal in the Beluga Coal Fields. Some estimates put the total at around 500 million tons. If the transport infrastructure to Cook Inlet is built, it is likely that, over time, coal mining in the region would expand.


=== Environmental issues of the mining phase ===
2006 revisions to PacRim's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) filing with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shows the company expects to discharge more than 7,400,000 US gallons (28,000 m3) of mine area runoff daily into salmon-bearing tributaries of the Chuitna River, including Creek 2002 (Lone Creek), Creek 2003 (Middle Creek) and Creek 2004. That effluent would reach Cook Inlet. The NPDES documents demonstrate that PacRim anticipates a variety of discharge pollutants, including organic carbon, assorted suspended solids, ammonia, nitrates, oil and grease, and metals including aluminum, iron, and manganese. In addition, housing and other operational facilities would be expected to discharge small amounts of fecal coliform and residual chlorine. According to the NPDES filing, PacRim would build four sedimentation ponds to remove some suspended solids. Three ponds would receive runoff from areas affected by mining operations, the fourth would receive runoff from mine facilities. Four outfall locations would discharge effluent to the fresh water creeks, waterbodies that support all five species of Pacific salmon, as well as Dolly Varden and trout.
PacRim's mining project would carve through more than 11 miles (18 km) of Middle Creek. To date, no permit allowing mining operations to mine through and destroy a salmon stream has ever been issued by the Alaska Department of Natural Resources. Such a permit would be precedent-setting. Alaska has strict laws governing the protection of natural systems such as salmon streams. A clean, clear-water environment is crucial for successful natural salmon rearing. How those laws might be applied during the permitting process remains to be seen.
PacRim's planned port at Ladd Landing would affect existing shoreline salmon set net fishing sites and the coal-loading trestle necessary to reach deep water would affect fish migration zones and the habitat of an endangered species of beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas also known as white whale) that is distinct to Cook Inlet. Under provisions of the 1973 Endangered Species Act, the National Marine Fisheries Service placed the Cook Inlet species on the nation's Endangered Species list. What effect that may have on permitting PacRim's port facilities has yet to be determined.


=== Post-mining environmental concerns ===
Repairing the damage surface strip mining leaves behind is costly and a considerable physical enterprise. A specific federal law governs such recovery phases, and would apply to a Chuitna Coal Project. It is called the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977. The act created the Office of Surface Mining within the U.S. Department of the Interior. State programs - in Alaska's case, the Alaska Division of Mining, Land & Water - generally regulate mines, but among the OSM's jobs is inspecting state programs to ensure they are meeting federal requirements.

Alpha-2-Macroglobulin,"['Acute-phase proteins', 'Genes on human chromosome 12']","α2-Macroglobulin (α2M), or alpha-2-macroglobulin, is a large (720 KDa) plasma protein found in the blood. It is mainly produced by the liver, and also locally synthesized by macrophages, fibroblasts, and adrenocortical cells. In humans it is encoded by the A2M gene.
α2-Macroglobulin acts as an antiprotease and is able to inactivate an enormous variety of proteinases. It functions as an inhibitor of fibrinolysis by inhibiting plasmin and kallikrein. It functions as an inhibitor of coagulation by inhibiting thrombin. α2-macroglobulin may act as a carrier protein because it also binds to numerous growth factors and cytokines, such as platelet-derived growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, TGF-β, insulin, and IL-1β.
No specific deficiency with associated disease has been recognized, and no disease state is attributed to low concentrations of α2-macroglobulin. The concentration of α2-macroglobulin rises 10-fold or more in the nephrotic syndrome when other lower molecular weight proteins are lost in the urine. The loss of α2-macroglobulin into urine is prevented by its large size. The net result is that α2-macroglobulin reaches serum levels equal to or greater than those of albumin in the nephrotic syndrome, which has the effect of maintaining oncotic pressure.","α2-Macroglobulin (α2M), or alpha-2-macroglobulin, is a large (720 KDa) plasma protein found in the blood.

The loss of α2-macroglobulin into urine is prevented by its large size. The net result is that α2-macroglobulin reaches serum levels equal to or greater than those of albumin in the nephrotic syndrome, which has the effect of maintaining oncotic pressure.


== Structure ==
Human α2-macroglobulin is composed of four identical subunits bound together by -S-S- bonds. In addition to tetrameric forms of α2-macroglobulin, dimeric, and more recently monomeric αM protease inhibitors have been identified.Each monomer of human α2-macroglobulin is composed of several functional domains, including macroglobulin domains, a thiol ester-containing domain and a receptor-binding domain. Overall, α2-macroglobulin is the largest major nonimmunoglobulin protein in human plasma.
The amino acid sequence of α2-macroglobulin has been shown to be 71% the same as that of the pregnancy zone protein (PZP; also known as pregnancy-associated α2-glycoprotein).


== Function ==
The α-macroglobulin (αM) family of proteins includes protease inhibitors, typified by the human tetrameric α2-macroglobulin (α2M); they belong to the MEROPS proteinase inhibitor family I39, clan IL. These protease inhibitors share several defining properties, which include (1) the ability to inhibit proteases from all catalytic classes, (2) the presence of a 'bait region' (also known as a sequence of amino acids in an α2-macroglobulin molecule, or a homologous protein, that contains scissile peptide bonds for those proteinases that it inhibits) and a thiol ester, (3) a similar protease inhibitory mechanism and (4) the inactivation of the inhibitory capacity by reaction of the thiol ester with small primary amines. αM protease inhibitors inhibit by steric hindrance. The mechanism involves protease cleavage of the bait region, a segment of the αM that is particularly susceptible to proteolytic cleavage, which initiates a conformational change such that the αM collapses about the protease. In the resulting αM-protease complex, the active site of the protease is sterically shielded, thus substantially decreasing access to protein substrates. Two additional events occur as a consequence of bait region cleavage, namely (1) the h-cysteinyl-g-glutamyl thiol ester becomes highly reactive and (2) a major conformational change exposes a conserved COOH-terminal receptor binding domain  (RBD). RBD exposure allows the αM protease complex to bind to clearance receptors and be removed from circulation. Tetrameric, dimeric, and, more recently, monomeric αM protease inhibitors have been identified.α2-Macroglobulin is able to inactivate an enormous variety of proteinases (including serine-, cysteine-, aspartic- and metalloproteinases). It functions as an inhibitor of fibrinolysis by inhibiting plasmin and kallikrein. It functions as an inhibitor of coagulation by inhibiting thrombin. α2-Macroglobulin has in its structure a 35 amino acid ""bait"" region. Proteinases binding and cleaving the bait region become bound to α2M. The proteinase–α2M complex is recognised by macrophage receptors and cleared from the system.

α2-Macroglobulin is known to bind zinc, as well as copper in plasma, even more strongly than albumin, and such it is also known as transcuprein. 10 to 15% of copper in human plasma is chelated by α2-macroglobulin.


== Disease ==
α2-Macroglobulin levels are increased when the serum albumin levels are low, which is most commonly seen in nephrotic syndrome, a condition wherein the kidneys start to leak out some of the smaller blood proteins. Because of its size, α2-macroglobulin is retained in the bloodstream. Increased production of all proteins means α2-macroglobulin concentration increases. This increase has little adverse effect on the health, but is used as a diagnostic clue.
A common variant (29.5%) (polymorphism) of α2-macroglobulin leads to increased risk of Alzheimer's disease.α2-Macroglobulin binds to and removes the active forms of the gelatinase (MMP-2 and MMP-9) from the circulation via scavenger receptors on the phagocytes.

== Life ==
He was the son of Richard Reeve, and was matriculated to Trinity College, Oxford in 1688 at the age of 15, joining Inner Temple in 1690. In 1698 he was called to the Bar, migrating to Middle Temple in 1713. He was called to the Inn bench in 1720, and served as treasurer in 1728. In 1717 he became a King's counsel, and in 1722 became attorney-general of the Duchy of Lancaster. He was at this point one of the most prolific barristers in Britain. An analysis of records show that in 1720 he was appearing in more cases than any other barrister in the Court of the King's Bench.  He was appointed a judge in the King's Bench on 18 November 1723.On 17 April 1733, he became a Puisne justice of the Court of Common Pleas, and was created a Serjeant-at-law at the same time to satisfy the minimum requirements for the office. After the death of Sir Robert Eyre in office in 1735 Reeve was rumoured to be succeeding him, but had competition in the form of Alexander Denton, who he had previously succeeded as attorney-general of the Duchy of Lancaster; Denton was rejected on grounds of ill-health, however, and Reeve was promoted on 26 January 1736, and knighted at the same time. He was appointed to the Privy Council shortly after. He died in office within a year on 19 January 1737, and was buried in Temple Church on 28 January. He was at the time of his death very wealthy, including over £22,000 in personal property, as well as land in Berkshire and London; he was apparently courted by Lord Sidney Beauclerk, an infamous fortune-seeker, who hoped to be given a legacy, although without success. He was married to Annabella Topham, whose brother Richard Topham was Keeper of the Records at the Tower of London; Beauclerk later succeeded in getting the estate of Richard in and around Windsor and Old Windsor.
The memorial to Sir Thomas and his wife (with busts) stands in John the Baptist Church in Windsor and is by Peter Scheemakers.

== Gameplay ==
Ys IX: Monstrum Nox is an action role-playing game played from a third-person perspective. It further builds on the gameplay foundation of Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana, where players control multiple main characters that can be switched between on-the-fly, each with their own play styles and unique skills. Players collect a variety of weapons and items by defeating enemies and opening chests.
Players can consume SP to unleash a character's unique skill attack, and SP can be restored by landing hits on enemies or it can regenerate faster when the player is not attacking. Boost mode, a returning game mechanic from Ys: The Oath in Felghana and Ys Origin, temporarily increases damage dealt, decreases damage received, and increases attack and movement speeds.New to Ys IX, each party member has traversal abilities, called Monstrum Gifts, such as gliding and running up walls. Players can reach various places and locate hidden secrets in the city of Balduq and dungeons by utilizing these actions.

Nihon Falcom president Toshihiro Kondo stated that he wanted the next Ys game to lean more towards the adventure genre, with Dana's arc in Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana as a hint. In another interview, Kondo said that he wanted to take the new axis of direction and movement introduced in Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana to the next level, citing examples such as an air dash or a hook shot.The game was developed by Nihon Falcom and released for the PlayStation 4 in Japan on September 26, 2019. It was released by NIS America for the PlayStation 4 in North America, Europe and Oceania respectively on February 2, February 5, and February 12, 2021, with additional releases for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, and Stadia in July 2021.

He is considered to be a pioneer of refractive surgery.

He is considered to be a pioneer of refractive surgery. He was also one of the candidates in the 1996 Russian presidential election, running as a member of the Party of Workers' Self-Government.


== Life and career ==
Fyodorov was born in Proskurov, Ukrainian SSR (now Khmelnytskyi, Ukraine), to ethnic Russian parents. 
Fyodorov graduated from Rostov Medical Institute in Rostov on Don, then worked as a practicing ophthalmologist in a small town in Rostov Oblast.


=== Cataract surgery ===
In the 1960s he studied the pioneering work of the English ophthalmic surgeon Sir Harold Ridley, the inventor of the intraocular lens (IOL). Fyodorov began to use Ridley's intraocular lenses in his treatment of cataract. At first he used lenses manufactured by the Rayner company in England but he quickly moved to have his lenses manufactured inside the Soviet Union.


=== Refractive surgery ===
In the 1970s he developed the surgical technique he is most famous for, the radial keratotomy, to change the shape of the cornea and cure myopia. In 1986, Fyodorov designed the first posterior chamber phakic IOL in the ""collar-button"" or ""mushroom"" configuration and manufactured the pIOL from silicone. In 1980 he became the head of the Moscow Research Institute of Eye Microsurgery. In 1988 he founded the Fyodorov Eye Microsurgery Complex.
In 1994 he endorsed and wrote the foreword to the American textbook (Radial and Astigmatic Keratotomy) by  Dr. Spencer Thornton in which Thornton taught a surgical technique derived from but markedly different from the Fyorodov technique.


== Politics ==
In the 1980s through the early 1990s, Fyodorov called for repeal of the Soviet Union's one-party system while still a member of the Communist Party.Fyodorov was a member of the Congress of People's Deputies in 1989-1991.
In 1991 he rejected an offer by Boris Yeltsin to become Russia's premier.Considered one of the Soviet Union's first highly successful practicing capitalists, he was a proponent for the denationalization of the economy. On June 12, 1991, the day of Russia's inaugural presidential election, Fyodorov told state media that he believed that Russia's revival hinged on the ""de-statization""  of property. Fyodorov argued that, ""If in the US the main means of production are concentrated in  the hands of 13% of the population"", then Russia should distribute ownership of those resources among 50-60% of its population through the creation of ""people's enterprises"" and joint-stock companies. ""We have the biggest scientific community in the world, where the intellectual component constitutes 90% of industrial costs. This factor plus our natural resources and territory give us a chance, in the course of one generation, to leave behind the US and, perhaps, Japan,"" he said.In 1992 he became the co-chairman of the Party of Economic Freedom, an early liberal party.Fyodorov was elected to the lower house of the Russian parliament, the State Duma, in 1995, the chairman of his own small party.Considered to be on the center-left of the Russian political spectrum, Fyodorov was the founder and leader of the Party of Workers' Self-Government, which was one of the most influential social-democratic movements in Russia during the 1990s.In 1994 Fyodorov had described his political objective by stating, ""I want peasants to own farms, workers to own factories, physicians to own clinics, and everyone to pay a 30% tax, and the rest is theirs.""


=== Presidential campaign ===
Fyodorov ran as the candidate of the Party of Workers' Self-Government in the 1996 Russian presidential electionAs a presidential candidate, Fyodorov advocated for the mass creation of joint stock companies to guarantee workers a share of profits and allow them to actively participate in management of their companies. He dubbed this concept ""democratic capitalism"" or ""popular socialism"". Fyodorov advocated for economic freedom, simple and moderate taxation, stimulation of production, and a ban on exports of most raw materials. Fyodorov promised that his policies would double the nation's GDP within five years. Fyodorov proclaimed to draw inspiration in his politics from both Ross Perot and Deng Xiaoping.Up until early May, Fyodorov unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate the creation of a third force coalition, with negotiations largely centering on a coalition between him and fellow candidates Yavlinsky and Lebed.


== Death ==
Returning from an academic conference in 2000, Fyodorov died in the crash of his clinic's four-seater helicopter on the outskirts of Moscow.


== Reception and legacy ==
In 2013, a profile of Dr. Fyodorov was included in a book called Saving Sight: An eye surgeon's look at life behind the mask and the heroes who changed the way we see, by Andrew Lam, M.D.

It is located at the corner of West 25th Street and Lorain Avenue in the Ohio City neighborhood. On December 18, 1973, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.","The West Side Market is the oldest operating indoor/outdoor market space in Cleveland, Ohio. It is located at the corner of West 25th Street and Lorain Avenue in the Ohio City neighborhood. On December 18, 1973, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.


== History ==
The market began operating in 1840, across the street from its current location. Josiah Barber and Richard Lord, prominent businessmen and both former mayors of Ohio City before it was incorporated into Cleveland, donated land to Ohio City's government, stipulating that the tract be used for an open-air neighborhood market. The market space became a center of the Ohio City community for the next three decades and other benefactors donated adjacent lands allowing the marketplace to expand. In 1868, a one-story, wooden framed building was erected on the site, and the newly christened Pearl Street Market was opened.
Thanks to brisk population growth in Cleveland and Ohio City in the latter part of the 19th century, the market outgrew its space again. In 1902, lands were purchased across the street from the Pearl Market site to allow for market expansion and eventual construction of additional indoor market space. Cleveland architectural firm Hubbell and Benes was contracted to create the new indoor space and, after nearly a decade of planning and construction, the current West Side Market building was completed in 1912 at a cost of nearly $680,000. The Neo-Classical/Byzantine building is a brick construct with a large interior concourse that provides nearly 100 stalls for sellers and an 85-stall outdoor produce arcade that wraps around the side and rear of the main building. In addition, the building has a large clock tower, easily visible from most of Ohio City in the building's early days.

In 1915, the permanent building spurred sellers to establish the West Side Market Tenants' Association, a coalition founded to help maintain the market and organize for future improvements and additions. This organization exists at the Market today.
Periodic upgrades accommodated more tenants and maintained and improved the overall conditions. A fuller, $1.1 million modernization was undertaken in 1953 to add lower-level storage areas and upgrade stalls in the arcade. Another renovation, this one for $5 million, took place after the Market was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.
The market's profile rose in the latter 20th century. Politicians passing through Cleveland often stopped in to sample the array of foods sold at the market on any given day. The market also began sponsoring major food festivals in the neighborhood which drew people from Cleveland and the rest of the world. Despite the successes of the 1980s, however, the market began to face financial straits as Cleveland itself was experiencing monetary struggles. A large portion of the market's subsidies from the city dried up, leaving tenants facing higher rents to keep the market open. Yet the market expanded and was renovated throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century.
A 2004 project enclosed and added space heating to the arcade portion of the market, as well as completed major interior and architectural renovations to the main building. The market's centennial was celebrated in 2012.

Most residents of the neighborhood and many Clevelanders still do a large portion of their shopping at the market. The market is open to customers Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Saturdays from 7:00 a.m to 5:00 p.m., and Sundays from 10 p.m to 4:00 p.m.The market attracts tourists from all parts of the United States, who visit and learn about its history. Guided tours are offered. Its national profile has been boosted in recent years by coverage on various programs produced by the Travel Channel and Food Network.
Many stalls have remained under individual family control for much of the life of the market, several dating to 1912. The market's tenants and sellers reflect the cultural diversity of the surrounding neighborhood and Cleveland as a whole. The current roster of tenants includes those of Irish, German, Slovene, Italian, Hungarian, Greek, Polish, Russian, and Middle Eastern descent, among others.
In the September 2010 issue of Food Network Magazine, the West Side Market was named America's ""Best Food Lovers' Market.""

On January 30, 2013, the market was temporarily closed after a fire left smoke and soot damage.In 2016 city officials announced that starting April 3 of that year the market would add regular Sunday hours for the first time in its history.

Ranked the top player in North America and widely regarded as one of the greatest Scrabble players, Gibson won the North American Scrabble Championship twice. 


== Early life ==
The eldest of three children, David Lawrence Gibson was born in 1951 in Raleigh, North Carolina and raised in Charlotte, North Carolina, where his parents owned a auto parts locating company. A graduate of North Mecklenburg High School and Furman University, he excelled in mathematics but fared considerably poorly in English. In 1975, Gibson and his family moved to Spartanburg, South Carolina.


== Career ==
Gibson was introduced to Scrabble at age 6. He began playing tournament Scrabble in 1983 and won the North American Scrabble Championship (NASC) in August 1994; although he had kept a relatively low profile in the Scrabble community, the win propelled him to No. 1 in the North American rankings. In 1995, Gibson won the ""Scrabble Superstars"" tournament and its top prize of $50,000. Gibson finished second in the 2012 NASC; only needing to lose by fewer than 169 points to win the title, he ended up losing 298-475 in the final round against Nigel Richards. In 2016, Gibson won his second NASC title in Fort Wayne, Indiana. The term ""Gibsonization"" for a process of pairings in a single-elimination final was named after Gibson due to his tendency to clinch tournaments before their final rounds. Gibson also taught mathematics for some four decades at the Spartanburg Methodist College, and was awarded with an honorary distinction of Professor Emeritus by the college in early 2019.


== Death ==
Gibson died aged 68 on November 22, 2019, due to complications from stage four pancreatic cancer.

The song was covered by many artists, including by Gigi D'Agostino (1999) and Jack Holiday and Mike Candys (2012).


== Lyrics ==
The ""riddling"" lyrics caused speculation among listeners as to their meaning; Kershaw states that there is in fact no intended meaning at all, the words simply being a ""guide vocal"" thrown together to fit the music. Kershaw has stated: ""In short, 'The Riddle' is nonsense, rubbish, bollocks, the confused ramblings of an 80s popstar.""


== Music video ==
The music video to ""The Riddle"" depicts Kershaw walking through a house shaped like a question mark, making his way through certain obstacles and looking through drawers while singing. The video depicts many references to Lewis Carroll's book Alice in Wonderland with an appearance of a young girl exiting the room through a small door, two portly gentlemen who resemble Tweedledum and Tweedledee and an observation made by Kershaw to Through the Looking Glass.
At the beginning of the music video Kershaw is seen trying to get through a door with a screwdriver. The video ends with the camera moving up away from Kershaw to reveal that the question mark is lying in an alleyway, at which point a man in a green costume seen earlier in the video comes and picks it up. The green man is the Riddler, a villain from the Batman comics.
Two versions of the video exist, with minor differences.

He was born in Peel on the Isle of Man in 1856 or 1857, the son of Lauris and Eliza Clark.In 1889 he married Agnes Roberts (born 1872), and their children were: David (born 1891), Dora (born 1891), Constance (born 1893), Grace (born 1895), Josephine (born 1897), Rose (born 1898), Joseph Cecil (1900–1989), Cecil William (1900–1989), Alice Ivy (1906–1927), and Joseph (born 1911). Around 1892, Clark moved with his family to Chichester in West Sussex.


== Career ==

Clark had many occupations during his lifetime, including designer of cigarette cards and postcards, and as a fore-edge painter principally specializing in characters from the works of Charles Dickens. He worked for Punch for only one day and then as a freelance artist until 1900.
Clark's illustrations from Dickens first appeared in 1887 in Fleet Street Magazine, with two published collections appearing shortly after as The Characters of Charles Dickens (1889) and Some Well Known Characters from the Works of Charles Dickens (1892). Kyd's representations from the works of Dickens owe much to the original illustrations of Hablot Knight Browne ('Phiz') and Robert Seymour (the first illustrator of The Pickwick Papers, one of Clark's most popular themes), while the modelling of the characters seems to be based on Phiz's later designs from the 1870s. Early in the twentieth century five sets of postcards based on his Dickens drawings were published, as well as seven sets of non-Dickensian comic cards.
From 1927 Clark earned his living from watercolor sketches, mainly of Dickens' characters, which he sold to and through the London book trade. Frederic G. Kitton referred to Clark in his book Dickens and His Illustrators (1890), by which time Clark's watercolors were already being bought by major Dickens collectors. The auction of the Dickens collection of F W Cosens FSA of Clapham Park, held at Christie's on 17 May 1890, sold a collection of 241 of Clark's Dickens watercolors, and Tom Wilson, at the time the foremost collector of Dickens, owned 331 of Clark's drawings.

""As a character 'Kyd' emulated those of Dickens and his own illustrations – slightly larger than life. In his style and dress he was mildly flamboyant for the period. He seldom varied his attire from a grey suit, spats, homburg hat, gloves and was never without a carnation or substitute flower in his button hole.""
Apart from his Dickens work, ""Kyd"" also illustrated humorous series such as ""Some Typical Newspaper Readers"" (c.1900), ""The Book and Its Reader"", and ""London Types"". He also illustrated a series of 50 smokers for Gallaher Ltd.; this series was issued as a set of cigarette cards entitled 'Votaries of the Weed' in 1916.
In 1910 the British Museum acquired a collection of 598 drawings and paintings of Clark's Dickens illustrations, and the Victoria and Albert Museum, Charles Dickens Museum and the University of Texas at Austin each also have significant collections of Clark's Dickens illustrations.


== Death ==
Joseph Clayton Clark died in the New End Hospital in Hammersmith in London in August 1937.


== Honored as UK stamp art ==
Six of his illustrations were issued as stamps by the Royal Mail in 2012 to mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Dickens.

== Meaning of ""Four Corners of the World"" ==

The term ""four corners of the world"" appears in several ancient mythologies and cosmologies, wherein it roughly corresponds the four points of the compass. In most of these representations, four principal rivers run to these four corners, their water irrigating the four quadrants (or quarters) of the world. In the view of the Mesopotamian Akkadians, the term referred to four regions on the edge of the then known world; Subartu (probably corresponding to the region of Assyria) in the north, Martu (roughly corresponding to modern Syria) in the west, Elam in the east and Sumer in the south. To Naram-Sin of Akkad (r. 2254–2218 BC), the creator of the title, it probably, in geographical terms, expressed his dominion over the regions Elam, Subartu, Amurru and Akkad (representing east, north, west and south respectively).The term thus covers a somewhat clear geographical region, corresponding to Mesopotamia and its surroundings, but should be understood as referring to the entire known world. At the point in time when the title was first used, the 2200s BC, the Mesopotamians would have equated all of Mesopotamia to the entire world; the region was highly productive, densely populated and was bordered on all sides by seemingly empty and uninhabited lands. A title the like of King of the Four Corners of the World should be taken as meaning that its holder was the ruler of the entire Earth and everything within it. The title can be interpreted as being equivalent to calling oneself ""King of all the known world"". Thus, the title is an example of merism, combining contrasting concepts to refer to an entirety (the four corners being on the edges of the world and the title referring to them and everything in between).


== History ==


=== Background (2900–2334 BC) ===

During the Early Dynastic Period in Mesopotamia (c. 2900–2350 BC), the rulers of the various city-states in the region would often launch invasions into regions and cities far from their own, at most times with negligible consequences for themselves, in order to establish temporary and small empires to either gain of keep a superior position relative to the other city-states. This early empire-building was encouraged as the most powerful monarchs were often rewarded with the most prestigious titles, such as the title of lugal (literally ""big man"" but often interpreted as ""king"", probably with military connotations). Most of these early rulers had probably acquired these titles rather than inherited them.Eventually this quest to be more prestigious and powerful than the other city-states resulted in a general ambition for universal rule. Since Mesopotamia was equated to correspond to the entire world and Sumerian cities had been built far and wide (cities the like of Susa, Mari and Assur were located near the perceived corners of the world) it seemed possible to reach the edges of the world (at this time thought to be the lower sea, the Persian gulf, and the upper sea, the Mediterranean).Rulers attempting to reach a position of universal rule became more common during the Early Dynastic IIIb period (c. 2450–2350 BC) during which two prominent examples are attested. The first, Lugalannemundu, king of Adab, is claimed by the Sumerian King List (though this is a much later inscription, making the extensive rule of Lugalennemundu somewhat doubtful) to have created a great empire covering the entirety of Mesopotamia, reaching from modern Syria to Iran, saying that he ""subjugated the Four Corners"". The second, Lugalzaggesi, king of Uruk, conquered the entirety of Lower Mesopotamia and claimed (despite this not being the case) that his domain extended from the upper to the lower sea. Lugalzaggesi was originally titled as simply ""King of Uruk"" and adopted the title ""King of the Land"" (Sumerian: lugal-kalam-ma) to lay claim to universal rule. This title had also been employed by some earlier Sumerian kings claiming control over all of Sumer, such as Enshakushanna of Uruk.


=== Sumerian Kings of the Four Corners (2334–2004 BC) ===

Sargon, king of Akkad, unified Lower and Upper Mesopotamia, creating the first true Mesopotamian empire. Though Sargon most commonly used the title ""King of Akkad"" (šar māt Akkadi), he also introduced the more boastful title of šar kiššatim (""King of Everything"" or ""King of the Universe""), used prominently by his successors. The title of ""King of the Four Corners of the World"" is first attested to have been used by the Akkadian king Naram-Sin, the grandson of Sargon of Akkad and the fourth ruler of the Akkadian Empire. Naram-Sin also proclaimed himself to be a living god (the first Mesopotamian king to do so), making his capital of Akkad not only the political but also the religious center of the empire. It is possible that Naram-Sin might have been inspired to claim the title following his conquest of the city Ebla, in which quadripartite divisions of the world and the universe were prominent parts of the city's ideology and beliefs.The title of King of the Four Corners suggests that Naram-Sin viewed himself not merely as a Mesopotamian ruler but as a universal ruler who happened to conform to the usual Mesopotamian royal traditions, the monarch of a new empire that not only incorporated the city-states of Mesopotamia but the lands beyond as well. In particular, art made during the period starts to incorporate previously unseen objects such as highland plants and animals and mountains, previously seen as highly foreign objects. Their increasing appearance in art suggests that they were seen as belonging to the empire of Akkad as much as everything else did. It is possible that šar kiššatim referred to the authority to govern the cosmological realm whilst ""King of the Four Corners"" referred to the authority to govern the terrestrial. Eitherway, the implication of these titles was that the Mesopotamian king was the king of the entire world.The title doesn't appear to have been used by any of Naram-Sin's direct successors of the Akkadian Empire, which began to collapse during the reign of Naram-Sin's son Shar-Kali-Sharri. In the 2100s BC, the Gutians attacked the Akkadian Empire and supplanted the ruling ""Sargonic"" dynasty, destroying the city of Akkad and establishing an empire of their own. By 2112 BC, the Gutians had been driven out and the city of Ur had become the center of a new Sumerian civilization, referred to as the Third Dynasty of Ur or the Neo-Sumerian Empire. The rulers of this empire emulated the previous monarchs from Akkad, referring to themselves as ""Kings of Sumer and Akkad"" and all of them—with the exception of the founder of the dynasty, Ur-Nammu—used the title of ""King of the Four Corners of the World"". Some ancient sources confer the title onto Ur-Nammu as well, referring to him as ""King in Heaven and the Four Corners of the World"", but these inscriptions date to centuries after his reign.


=== Assyrian Kings of the Four Corners  (1366–627 BC) ===

With the collapse of the Neo-Sumerian Empire in c. 2004 BC, the title fell into disuse once more. Except for the Babylonian king Hammurabi who claimed to be ""the king who made the four corners of the Earth obedient"" in 1776 BC, the title was not used until occasionally by Assyrian kings of the Middle-Assyrian Empire, often as ""King of All the Four Corners of the World"" (šar kullat kibrāt erbetti).The first king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, Adad-nirari II (r. 911–891 BC), used the title of ""King of the Four Corners"". The concept of a king governing the four corners of the world was well-established by the reign of the second king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, Tukulti-Ninurta II (r. 891–884 BC), who claimed to have been ""he whose honoured name he has pronounced forever for the four corners"" (ana mu urut kibrāt erbetti ana dāriš išquru) and ""governor of the four corners"" (muma'er kibrāt erbetti). In Assyria, the deity Ashur was referred to as ""[the one] who makes the king's kingship surpass the kings of the four quarters"" (mušarbû šarrūtija eli šarrāni ša kibrāt erbetti).Tukulti-Ninurta II's son and successor, Ashurnasirpal II (r. 883–859 BC) is in different inscriptions twice referred to as “King of the Totality of the Four Corners including all their rulers” (šar kiššat kibrāte ša napḫar malkī kalîšunu). The title is also attested for his son and successor, Shalmaneser III (r. 859–824 BC) and is the only title applied to this king by his successors.

The Kition stele, a large basalt stele discovered on Cyprus and the westernmost ancient Assyrian artifact known, identifies the king Sargon II, (r. 722–705 BC) with many titles, including ""King of the Universe"", ""King of Assyria"", ""King of Sumer and Akkad"", ""Governor of Babylon"" and ""King of the Four Corners of the World"". Sargon II's son and heir Sennacherib (r. 705–681 BC) did not immediately inherit the title, referring to himself simply as the ""unrivaled king"" at the beginning of his reign. Sennacherib conducted several military campaigns during his reign, after which he routinely added titles to his titulary. After his third campaign he added ""king of the world"" and after conquests in the Mediterranean Sea and Persian Gulf in 694 BC he added the title ""King from the Upper Sea of the Setting Sun to the Lower Sea of the Rising Sun"". It was only after Sennacherib had conducted campaigns to the south, east, west and north during his fifth campaign that he replaced the title of ""unrivaled king"" with ""King of the Four Corners of the World"". Sennacherib's son and heir, Esarhaddon (r. 681–669 BC) also used the title of ""King of the Four Corners of the World"" alongside that of ""King of the Universe"".Unlike the apparent dynastic inheritance of the title during the Neo-Sumerian Empire, it is possible that the title of King of the Four Corners had to be earned by each Assyrian king individually, thus explaining why the title is not attested for every Neo-Assyrian king and why Sennacherib first used it several years into his reign. British historian Stephanie Dalley, specializing in the Ancient Near East proposed in 1998 that the title may have had to be earned through the king successfully campaigning in all four points of the compass. Dalley also proposed that the similar title of ""King of the Universe"", with a virtually identical meaning, would have been earned through seven (which would have been connected to totality in the eyes of the Assyrians) successful campaigns. It would thus not have been possible for the king to claim either title before the required military campaigns. Periods during which the title was not used, such as the ~80-year gap between Shalmaneser III and Tiglath-Pileser III, probably reflect periods during which the military activity of the country and its kings declined.


=== Cyrus the Great (539 BC) ===
After the fall of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in 609 BC, the principal power in Mesopotamia was the Neo-Babylonian Empire. The founder of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, Nabopolassar, wished to associate himself with the previous Assyrian rulers to establish continuity and assumed many of the same titles such as šarru dannu (""mighty king"") and the much older Sumerian ""King of Sumer and Akkad"" (which had been used by the Neo-Assyrian rulers as well) but do not appear to have assumed the title of King of the Four Corners. Unlike previous ruling dynasties in Mesopotamia, the Neo-Babylonians usually only employed one royal title on any one occasion. Only rarely are examples with more than one royal title in use found from the Neo-Babylonian period, which might explain the absence of ""King of the Four Corners..."" since this was an additional prestigious title rather than a primary royal title. Nabopolassar's successors abandoned most of the old Assyrian titles, even abandoning the ""mighty king"" used by Nabopolassar. The only Neo-Babylonian king to assume the title of ""King of the Four Corners"" was Nabonidus, who in other aspects also tried to emulate the Assyrian kings.The Neo-Babylonian Empire ended with the conquest of Babylon by the Persian king Cyrus the Great, founder of the Achaemenid Persian Empire, in 539 BC. The Cyrus Cylinder is an ancient clay cylinder written in Akkadian cuneiform script in the name of Cyrus, made to be used as a foundation deposit and buried in the walls of Babylon. In the text of the cylinder, Cyrus assumes several traditional Mesopotamian titles including those of ""King of Babylon"", ""King of Sumer and Akkad"" and ""King of the Four Corners of the World"". The title was not used after the reign of Cyrus but his successors did adopt similar titles. The popular regnal title ""King of Kings"", used by monarchs of Iran until the modern age, was originally a title introduced by the Assyrian Tukulti-Ninurta I in the 13th century BC (rendered šar šarrāni in Akkadian). The title of ""King of Lands"", also used by Assyrian monarchs since at least Shalmaneser III, was also adopted by Cyrus the Great and his successors. Titles such as ""King of Kings"" and ""Great-King"" (šarru rabu), ancient titles with the connotation of holding supreme power in the lands surrounding Babylon, would remain in use up until the Sassanid dynasty in Persia of the 3rd to 7th centuries.

== Production ==


=== Background ===
The Mexican wrestling company Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (Spanish for ""World Wrestling Council""; CMLL) has held a number of major shows over the years using the moniker Sin Piedad (""No Pity"" or ""No Mercy""). CMLL has intermittently held a show billed specifically as Sin Piedad since 2000, primarily using the name for their ""end of the year"" show in December, although once they held a Sin Piedad show in August as well. CMLL has on occasion used a different name for the end-of-year show but Sin Piedad is the most commonly used name. All Sin Piedad shows have been held in Arena México in Mexico City, Mexico which is CMLL's main venue, its ""home"". Traditionally CMLL holds their major events on Friday Nights, which means the Sin Piedad shows replace their regularly scheduled Super Viernes show. The 2010 Sin Piedad show was the ninth show to use the name.


=== Storylines ===
The event featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the ""bad guys"") or faces (técnicos in Mexico, the ""good guy"" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.
The feature event and main selling point of the 2012 Sin Piedad event was the result of the storyline feud between CMLL and a group of wrestlers primarily associated with CMLL's main rival AAA known as Los Invasores. The Invasores storyline began on April 12, 2010 when a contingent of former AAA wrestlers including Psicosis, Histeria, Maniaco, El Alebrije and Cuije appeared during a CMLL show in Puebla, Puebla. The group drown into the arena in a black SUV and attacked La Sombra, El Hijo del Fantasma and La Máscara after they had just finished a match. In the following months the storyline became the main focus of CMLL's storylines and involved a number of different wrestlers. In the months leading up to the CMLL 77th Anniversary Show Rey Bucanero and the rest of La Peste Negra (El Felino and Negro Casas) facing off the Invasores trio of Charly Manson, Héctor Garza and the recently returned Mr. Águila. At the show La Peste Negra won the match, with Bucanero taking the deciding fall for his team. It was originally believed that Bucanero would face off against Charly Manson from Los Invasores, but instead Bucanero and Mr. Águila began focusing their efforts on each other, usually on opposite sides of various six-man tag team matches. In the weeks leading up to Sin Piedad Bucanero challenged Mr. Águila to put his hair on the line in a Lucha de Apuestas, or bet match between the two. Águila agreed and the two signed the contract for the main event a few weeks before the Sin Piedad event.
For years Victor Resendiz, better known as Latin Lover, had worked for AAA, making a name for himself. He had also been quite successful in other television appearances and broke away from AAA to handle his own match bookings. Following his departure AAA sought an injunction against him using the name ""Latin Lover"", claiming they owned the copyright to the name. In November 2010 he sat at ringside for a Friday night CMLL Super Viernes show, causing quite a stir with his appearance as he fought against Los Invasores, especially co-captain Héctor Garza who had been a rival of Latin Lover in AAA. Los Invasores attacked Rezendiz before he was saved by Shocker. Days later he was announced as using the ring name Latino in CMLL. It was later announced that Latino would team up with Guapos Internacional (Shocker and Jon Strongman) and CMLL's top tecnico Místico for Sin Piedad. The team would face Invasores co-captain Héctor Garza, teaming with CMLL rudos Atlantis and La Peste Negra (El Felino and Negro Casas).
In the fall of 2010 CMLL's Mini-Estrellas division began to focus on the storyline feud between the two enmascarados Pequeño Black Warrior and Eléctrico. The experienced Pequeño Black Warrior, a smaller version of Black Warrior started to target the tecnico Eléctrico during a number of matches, stating after one of the matches that he wanted the young, much less experienced Eléctrico to ""pay his dues"" in the ring. The feud started out during a six-man tag team match where Pequeño Warrior began targeting Eléctrico, often tearing his young opponent's mask open, at times even pulling it off at times to gain an unfair advantage in the match. After being the victim for a number of weeks Eléctrico fought back, at least once winning the match by pulling Pequeño Black Warrior's mask off. After several inconclusive matches the two masked wrestlers agreed to wrestle for the ultimate prize in Lucha Libre, their masks.
The third match of the night centered around the developing rivalry between the tecnico El Hijo del Fantasma (""Son of Fantasma"") and Mephisto, both second generation wrestlers. The rivalry had begun months earlier during a six-man tag team match in Guadalajara, Jalisco where a wrongly executed move by Hijo del Fantasma led to Mephisto accidentally being injured. Once the rudo returned to the ring he targeted Hijo del Fantasma to get his revenge. For the match Mephisto had back up from his fellow Los Hijos del Averno (""Sons of Hell"") members Averno and Ephesto, while Hijo del Fantasma teamed with two thirds of La Generacion Oro (""The Golden Generation"") La Sombra and La Mascara.
One wrestling magazine described the second match as Las futuras estrellas en accion (Spanish for ""The future stars in action""), with six wrestlers who were all looking to establish themselves as a top name in the promotion in the future. On one side two of the five Los Cancerberos del Infierno (""The Infernal Cerberus), Euforia and Pólvora would be teamed up with the most experienced wrestler in the match, Sangre Azteca. While Azteca was the most experienced he was still looking for an opportunity to ""break through"" and move up the ranks of CMLL past his current mid-card position. Their opponents was a team that did not usually team up as CMLL decided to team up three of their young tecnicos, Delta, Stuka Jr. and Valiente for the second match of the night, giving all six men the opportunity to perform on a high-profile show to demonstrate their skills in the ring.When Los Invasores originally appeared many people speculated that both female and Mini-Estrella Invasores would follow them to CMLL. Tiffany had originally worked for AAA for a number of years, but in mid-2010 she appeared on the CMLL affiliated Promociones Gutiérrez 1st Anniversary Show along with a number of other non-CMLL wrestlers. Weeks later she made her official CMLL debut becoming the first Invasora. She would soon be joined by Estrellita, who had been a tecnico in AAA but as part of Los Invasoras she played the rudo part instead. The two were often joined by another ""Outsider"", Mima Shimoda, who was a CMLL regular but from Japan and thus fit the ""Outsider"" image. The three ""Outsiders"" were matched up against two of CMLL's top female tecnicas, Dark Angel and Marcela as well as relative newcomer Luna Mágica, none of them had a specific storyline reason for being in the match beyond ""defending CMLL"".


== Event ==
In the opening match Las Invasoras lost the first fall when Marcela pinned Mima Shimoda, putting the CMLL side up by a fall in quick order. The outsiders fought back in the second fall, tying the match between the two teams. In the third and final match the least experienced member of the tecnico team, Luna Mágica, forced Estrellita to submit. The submission gave the CMLL team the victory in the opening match of the night. In the second match the tecnico team of Delta, Stuka Jr. and Valiente faced Sangre Azteca, Eurforia and Pólvora in a six-man tag team match. In the first fall Valiente displayed his high flying skills with what was described as a ""Spectacular flight"" by one source. The first fall went to the tecnico team, while the rudo team took the second fall in quick order. In the third and final fall problems between Sangre Azteca and Pólvora caused enough dissension on the team for the tecnicos to take advantage of it and gain the third and final fall for their team. Following the match Azteca and Pólvora began arguing and almost got into a fight.The fact that the driving storyline behind the third match was between Hijo del Famtasma and Mephisto was made obvious early on as Mephisto tore Hijo del Fantasma's mask apart in the first fall. La Mascara managed to secure the first fall for the tecnico team when he applied La Campana (""The Bell"" a reverse Boston Crab submission hold) on Averno. In the second fall Hijo del Fantasma pays Mephisto back by ripping Mephisto's mask apart in several places, but in the end Mephisto retaliates and tears Hijo del Fantasma's mask totally off, which is an automatic disqualification in Lucha Libre. With the DQ the team of Hijo del Fantasma, La Mascara and La Sombra won the match, but Mephisto left the arena with Hijo del Fantasma's mask as a trophy. For the fourth match of the night, the first Luchas de Apuesta, Eléctrico was accompanied by Ángel de Oro while Pequeño Black Warrior had fellow Mini-Estrella rudo Pequeño Olímpico in his corner for the high-profile match. The first fall quickly went to Pequeño Warrior, putting the tecnico Eléctrico behind and forcing him to claw and fight back to win the second fall of the match. The third fall saw both wrestlers turn up the intensity as they fought for their masked identity, but in the end the younger Eléctrico won the fall and the match by submission. Following the match Pequeño Black Warrior unmasked in the middle of the ring as lucha libre traditions dictate and revealed that his real name was Humberto Sánchez Medorio and had been a professional wrestler for 20 years. With the unmasking it was confirmed that he was the same wrestler who had originally played the original Mini Psicosis in AAA as many people had suspected.During the introduction of the participants of the fifth match the rudos, who had entered first, jumped Guapos Internacional (Shocker and Strongman) with La Peste Negra attacking Strongman while Atlantis jumped on Shocker as he entered the ring. When Latino entered the ring rival Héctor Garza attacked him from behind. The arrival of Místico drew a standing ovation from the crowd, but it did not turn the advantage as the rudos kept beating down their opponents even before the bell. Once the bell rang the rudos ignored the referee's instructions and were disqualified for excessive violence against the tecnico team. In the second fall Latino ended up with Garza in a pinning predicament, and despite the intentionally slow count from crooked referee El Titantes Latino won the second fall, taking the match in two straight falls for his side. The main event was refereed by El Tirantes, a rudo referee that especially took the side of Los Invasores since he also worked for AAA for many years. Mr. Águila was the first, followed by Rey Bucanero who was accompanied by Perico the parrot, his mascota. The crowd was solidly behind the ""home team"" of Rey Bucanero, voicing their support even before the opening bell rang. During the first fall El Tirantes allowed Mr. Águila to blatantly cheat to take the first fall. Following the match Jose Luis Mendieta, a representative of the Mexico City boxing and wrestling commission, removed El Tirantes as referee of the match and replaced him with Baby Richards, an impartial referee. With his advantage gone Mr. Águila was on the defensive from the beginning and Bucanero managed to tie up the match with one fall apiece only minutes later. The third fall saw the advantage shift between the two with Mr. Águila looking like he was about to take Rey Bucanero's hair on several occasions, but in the end Bucanero pinned Mr. Águila to win the match. The crowd showed their vocal appreciation while Mr. Águila had his long mohawk shaved off in the middle of the ring.


== Aftermath ==
While the Los Invasores storyline continued after Sin Piedad the issue between Rey Bucanero and Mr. Águila was settled. Bucanero broke away from La Peste Negra to form La Fuerza TRT along with El Texano Jr. and El Terrible. Latino only made one more appearance for CMLL before leaving the company, dropping the storyline. On December 14, 2010, Shocker defeated El Texano Jr. to win the NWA World Historic Light Heavyweight Championship. However, just five days later he suffered a patellar tendon rupture and a meniscal tear in his knee that required surgery and would sideline him for 12 to 16 weeks. When Shocker returned no mention was made of Guapos Internacional, nor did Shocker team with Jon Strongman on a regular basis. It was believed that the Hijo del Fantasma and Mephisto storyline would lead to a Luchas de Apuestas match, but the storyline was dropped in early 2011 when CMLL learned that Hijo del Fantasma had a try-out with the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) along with other CMLL wrestlers such as Místico. While Hijo del Fantasma did not get to WWE, Místico did leave CMLL to work under the ring name Sin Cara, leading to CMLL punishing those that participated in the try out that cost CMLL their main tecnico worker. After teasing a turn for weeks Sangre Azteca finally turned to the tecnico side in the weeks following Sin Piedad. Estrellita only remained with Las Invasoras for a short time after Sin Piedad, turning tecnica while Tiffany remained on the Rudo side but with no emphasis on her AAA past or any link to Los Invasores.

Chris Andrews’s English translation was published by Harvill Press/ New Directions in 2004. The story is based on ""The Infamous Ramírez Hoffman"", the last chapter of Bolaño's book of imaginary history of Nazi Literature in the Americas in which the protagonist's name is Carlos Ramírez Hoffman.","Distant Star (Spanish: Estrella distante) is a novella by Chilean author Roberto Bolaño, first published in Spanish in 1996.

The story is based on ""The Infamous Ramírez Hoffman"", the last chapter of Bolaño's book of imaginary history of Nazi Literature in the Americas in which the protagonist's name is Carlos Ramírez Hoffman.


== Plot summary ==
The book is narrated from a distance by Arturo B. (probably Arturo Belano, Bolaño's frequent stand-in) and tells the story of Alberto Ruiz-Tagle, an aviator who exploits the 1973 Chilean coup d'état to launch his own version of the New Chilean Poetry: a multi-media enterprise involving sky-writing, torture, photography, murder, and verse. 
The narrator first encounters Ruiz-Tagle in a college poetry workshop led by Juan Stein, where Ruiz-Tagle presents himself as a well-dressed, financially secure, self-taught writer with an unnaturally cool, distant, and calculated demeanor — in sharp contrast to the economically poor, messy, leftist, activist tendencies of the narrator (and most other poetry fans then enrolled at the University of Concepcion). Ruiz-Tagle also shows a surprising detachment from his own work, giving measured, intelligence criticism and receiving it without flinching.  Ruiz-Tagle also shows a disquieting lack of interest in having more than superficial social relationships with most of his fellow aspiring poets. Ruiz-Tagle’s most stable connection is with the beautiful Garmendia twins, Veronica and Angelica. While most of the young men in the twins’ social circle pine after them to one degree or another, the sisters only have eyes for Ruiz-Tagle.As the novel progresses it becomes clear that Ruiz-Tagle is far more and far less than a mere poet, through progressively darker and ironic twists and turns.
The next sighting comes as the narrator stands in a prison camp for political undesirables, gazing up at a World War II Messerschmitt skywriting over the Andes. The aviator is none other than Ruiz-Tagle, now serving in the Chilean air force under his actual name, Carlos Wieder, and writing nationalist slogans in the sky. The narrator becomes obsessed with Ruiz-Tagle, suspecting that he is behind every evil act in Pinochet’s regime. 
After his release from political prison, the narrator struggles to survive and make sense of his situation. His destiny is eventually reconnected with that of Ruiz-Tagle/Wieder when a Chilean private detective seeks his help in tracking Wieder down by trying to identify the air force pilot's hand behind various articles printed in neo-fascist publications.


== ""The Infamous Ramírez Hoffman"" ==
As stated in its introduction, Distant Star is an expansion of the final chapter of Bolaño's later work, Nazi Literature in the Americas, an encyclopedic novel composed of short biographies of imaginary Pan-American authors on the political right. The section, entitled ""The Infamous Ramírez Hoffman"", is the longest in the novel and is markedly different from the other sections of the book, taking on a less encyclopedic and more personal tone. In the expansion of the text, some of the characters' names remained unchanged (e.g. the narrator's fellow prisoner Norberto and the detective Abel Ramirez) but for most of the main characters, the names were altered:

In spite of the differences between the texts, Bolaño places them within the same fictional world, claiming that the story was narrated to him by Arturo B. in Nazi Literature in the Americas, but Arturo was displeased with the outcome:

""So we took that final chapter and shut ourselves up for a month and a half in my house in Blanes, where, guided by his dreams and nightmares, we composed the present novel. My role was limited to preparing refreshments, consulting a few books, and discussing the reuse of numerous paragraphs with Arturo and the increasingly animated ghost of Pierre Menard.""

Republic XP-69,"['1940s United States fighter aircraft', 'Aircraft with contra-rotating propellers', 'Articles with short description', 'Low-wing aircraft', 'Republic aircraft', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'Single-engined tractor aircraft']",The Republic XP-69 was an American fighter aircraft proposed by Republic Aviation in 1941 in response to a requirement by the United States Army Air Corps for a high-speed fighter. Manufacturers were encouraged to consider unorthodox designs; although the design was ordered as a prototype it was canceled because of delays with the engine that was to power it.,"The Republic XP-69 was an American fighter aircraft proposed by Republic Aviation in 1941 in response to a requirement by the United States Army Air Corps for a high-speed fighter. Manufacturers were encouraged to consider unorthodox designs; although the design was ordered as a prototype it was canceled because of delays with the engine that was to power it.


== Development ==
The United States Army Air Corps began the R40-C fighter competition in February 1940.  The competition encouraged manufacturers to propose unorthodox high-speed fighter aircraft that met the requirements of Type Specification XC-622.  The specification called for a single-engined high-performance fighter aircraft, with a maximum speed between 425 and 525 mph (684 and 845 km/h), armed with both machine guns and cannons, and be capable of landing on a 3,000 ft (910 m) long grass runway.Republic was one of six companies selected for the competition, and one of the aircraft proposed to the USAAC by Republic was the AP-12 Rocket.  As proposed, the AP-12 was to be powered by a 2,500 hp Wright R-2160-3 Tornado 42-cylinder liquid-cooled radial engine mounted in the mid-section of the aircraft's streamlined, cigar-shaped fuselage, behind the cockpit, which drove a pair of three-bladed contra-rotating propellers.  It was to be armed with four nose-mounted machine guns firing through the propeller arc, and a single 20 mm cannon firing through the propeller hub.  The AP-12 placed 13th out of 26 contestants, forcing Republic to go back to the drawing board to improve its proposal.In July 1941, Republic submitted an improved design, the AP-18.  The AP-18 had little in common with the AP-12.  It retained the original aircraft's R-2160 engine, which was now mounted in the nose of a completely new small-cross section airframe.  The large radiator was to be mounted under the fuselage.  The pressurized cockpit was to feature a bubble canopy, and an armament of four .50 in machine guns and two 37 mm cannons mounted in a laminar flow wing was planned.

In December 1941, the United States Army Air Forces (successor to the USAAC) ordered two prototypes of the AP-18 under the designation XP-69.  A mockup was built and was inspected by the USAAF in June 1942.  Construction of the first prototype began in November of that year.  However, due to development troubles and delays with the R-2160 engine, the XP-69 project was canceled in favor of a parallel development, the Republic XP-72, on May 24, 1943.  By that time engineering on the project was 75% complete and the prototype was still in the early stages of construction, with the total program cost being $810,000.

Pratt (April 24, 1819 – October 1891) was an American jurist and attorney. He served as the 2nd Associate Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court serving from 1848 to 1852.

Pratt (April 24, 1819 – October 1891) was an American jurist and attorney. He served as the 2nd Associate Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court serving from 1848 to 1852. He wrote the lone dissenting opinion in the controversy over the Oregon Territory’s capital between Oregon City and Salem.


== Early life ==
Pratt was born on April 24, 1819 in Ontario County, New York. In New York he attended the Army Academy at West Point from 1837 to 1839. He then studied law in Rochester, New York, earning admission to the state bar in 1841. Pratt then moved to Galena, Illinois and set up practice in 1843.


== Oregon ==
In 1849, Pratt moved to Oregon to assume the position of judge on the Oregon Supreme Court. When he arrived he was the lone justice, so he exercised all of the judiciary’s powers from April 1849 until William Strong arrived 18 months later. Pratt was appointed to the position by President Polk. Then in 1852 when Franklin Pierce became President Pratt was removed as judge, and when he was nominated to become chief justice of the Oregon court Stephen A. Douglas opposed the nomination and Pratt lost the nomination to George Henry Williams.While in office Pratt was controversial. He was known for traveling outside of the territory for his own personal gain, and took every opportunity to advance his personal, business, and political goals. During the dispute over the location of the capital in the territory, he took the minority position of choosing Salem, ultimately Congress would decide the matter in Salem’s favor in 1852. After leaving the court he was a judge of admiralty in Portland, Oregon in 1855 to 1856. He also practiced law with Alexander Campbell after failing to receiving a political office. Pratt then tried to get the money from the Ewing Young estate, but ultimately the Oregon Territorial Legislature and the Oregon Supreme Court denied the payment of the funds.


== Later years ==
In 1856, Pratt moved to San Francisco. There he owned the 18-square-mile (47 km2) Rancho Aguas Frias and had a fortune estimated at over $1 million. In California, Pratt practiced law in a partnership with Alex Campbell before being elected as judge of the twelfth judicial district. While in that office, he ruled in favor of Charlotte L. Brown in her lawsuit against a San Francisco streetcar company after she was ejected for being African-American, helping to end what he termed the ""barbaric practice"" of racial segregation. He was divorced in 1877, losing $750,000 ($15.5 million as measured in 2014 dollars) in the divorce settlement. His wife had discovered Pratt was having an affair, and in order to avoid prosecution for adultery he agreed to the large divorce settlement. He then married his former mistress, Eugenia Elizabeth Greene. Later in New York he was involved in a gambling issue where he refused to testify due to self incrimination issues. In 1886, the University of Oregon granted Pratt an honorary doctor of laws degree. Orville C. Pratt died in San Francisco in October 1891.

He raced in the World Touring Car Championship between 2011 and 2013.


== Career ==


=== Early years ===

Dudukalo started his racing career in 1995 in autocross racing. Five years later he switched to single–seaters. Dudukalo competed in Russian Formula 1600, where he was third in 2004 (his best result in open wheel series). He has very successful in the Supertourism/Tourism 1600 (champion in 2003) and the Russian Honda Civic Cup/Super Light Cup (champion in 2004–06), as well as the Touring-Light class of the Russian Touring Car Championship (champion in 2008 and 2009). In 2009 he finished 20th in the SEAT León Eurocup for Rangoni Motorsport. He also competed in the SEAT León Supercopa with the same team. For 2010 Dudukalo switched to Sunred Engineering. He improved to seventh position in standings with a win at Brno.


=== World Touring Car Championship ===


==== Lukoil-SUNRED (2011) ====
In 2011 Dudukalo moved up to the World Touring Car Championship, continuing his collaboration with SUNRED where he was joined by Gabriele Tarquini. He only scored points twice and finished the season 21st in the drivers' standings.


==== Lukoil Racing Team (2012) ====
Dudukalo was retained alongside Tarquini for 2012 with the team now run by Lukoil Racing. He had qualified eighth for the Race of Spain when his SEAT León WTCC caught fire in parc ferme. He qualified a career best second for the Race of Slovakia and finished in that position in race one behind his team mate to complete a Lukoil Racing Team 1–2, Dudukalo was also the Yokohama Independents' Trophy winner. However race two saw Dudukalo issued with a drive through penalty as all four of his wheels were not on the ground when the five-minute board was shown on the grid. He started on pole position for race two of the Race of Austria but was overtaken at the start by the BMWs of Tom Coronel and Stefano D'Aste. Dudukalo was one of a few drivers who had to pit during the race for fresh tyres due to punctures. He clashed with former SEAT León Eurocup rival Gábor Wéber at the Race of Portugal and went into a gravel trap but both drivers were able to return to the pits. He then clashed with ROAL Motorsport's Alberto Cerqui in race two of the Race of Brazil which caused Cerqui to crash into the pit wall. At the Race of the United States, having made it through to Q2 he beached his car near the end of the first session and brought the red flags out. He was then caught in a pileup at the start of race one which forced him to retire. A clash with Mehdi Bennani in the first race of the Race of Japan earned Dudukalo a 30–second post race penalty. He was classified fifteenth in the drivers' championship although still some way off his team mate.


==== Lukoil Lada Sport (2013) ====
Dudukalo will race alongside James Thompson at Lukoil Lada Sport in 2013. During qualifying for the Race of Italy Dudukalo missed the braking point for the first chicane and collided with his team–mate. Dudukalo was given a five–place grid drop for race one following the collision with Thompson. Lada later withdrew both of their cars prior to the races as neither could be repaired in time to participate. The incident put Dudukalo's seat in doubt with the team considering bringing in a replacement driver. Prior to the Race of Morocco he was replaced at the team by Mikhail Kozlovskiy.

== History ==
The Party was formed around Lon Nol's existing Socio-Republican Association, and was heavily influenced by his brother Lon Non and by the officers of the Khmer Republic's armed forces. It adopted the symbol of Angkor Wat, previously used by Prince Norodom Norindeth's Liberal Party from 1946–56. Its platform was populist, nationalist and anticommunist, Lon Nol being determined to oppose North Vietnamese and Chinese influence in the region in the context of the Second Indochina War: its three principal values were declared to be ""republicanism, social responsibility and nationalism"". The party's main function, however, was to support and legitimise Lon Nol's leadership of the country; he was later to develop a rather ramshackle chauvinist and semi-mystical ideology called ""Neo-Khmerism"" to back his political agenda.The party had, early on, developed two distinct factions. One, known as Dangrek, was led by veteran rightist radical, and (since 18 March) Prime Minister, Son Ngoc Thanh and the left-wing academic Hang Thun Hak. The Dangrek faction, named after the mountain range in which Thanh's Khmer Serei guerrillas had been based, attracted those figures who had long been part of the republican and radical opposition to Prince Norodom Sihanouk in the period before the Republic's establishment. The other faction, known as Dangkor, centred on Lon Non and the army. Tension between these two factions would later prove a serious obstacle to stable government.


== 1972 elections ==
The two main opposition parties, the Democratic Party led by In Tam and the Republican Party of Sirik Matak, did not take part in the National Assembly Elections, saying that there were some dubious points in the election law. The Social Republican Party fielded 126 candidates and won all of the seats. The only opposition were 10 candidates fielded by the Pracheachon group, a resurrected socialist party widely believed to have been organised by Lon Non as a token opposition.
In the elections to the Senate, the upper house of legislature, the 'token' opposition to the PSR was provided by a few candidates of the Sangkum, the former party of Sihanouk, who had been deposed as Head of State by Lon Nol in 1970. The Sangkum had been formally dissolved in 1971, but as with the Pracheachon was resurrected by Lon Non to provide the appearance of a multiparty election.


== Political infighting ==
Thanh's brief period as Prime Minister ended on 15 October 1972, shortly after an assassination attempt widely believed to have been organised by Lon Non. The PSR's Secretary-General, Hang Thun Hak, was made Prime Minister in his place, but was to be forced out in early 1973 after a period of increasingly poor outcomes for the Republic in the Cambodian Civil War. After a period in which In Tam served in the post, PSR member Long Boret was made Prime Minister in late 1973.
Lon Non attempted to strengthen his influence on the PSR, but was forced into exile in September 1973. He returned in 1974 and as late as March 1975 was still attempting to obtain the party's Secretary-Generalship, despite the Republic by this time holding little more than the city of Phnom Penh.
In April 1975, the Socio-Republican Party, along with the rest of the Khmer Republic regime, fell to the Khmer Rouge.

W. Goethals (ID-1443) was a United States Navy cargo ship and troop transport in commission in 1919.,"USS General G. W. Goethals (ID-1443) was a United States Navy cargo ship and troop transport in commission in 1919.


== Construction and acquisition ==
General G. W. Goethals was built in 1911 or 1912 as the German commercial passenger-cargo ship SS Grunewald at Vegesack, Germany, by Bremer Vulkan. Before the United States entered World War I, she became an American ship owned by the Panama Railroad Steamship Company of New York City.  The U.S. Navy acquired her on 10 March 1919, assigned her the naval registry Identification Number (Id. No.) 1443, and commissioned her the same day at Hoboken, New Jersey, as USS General G. W. Goethals with Lieutenant Commander Edward O. Roberts, USNRF, in command.


== United States Navy service ==
Assigned to the Cruiser and Transport Force and operated by the Navy under a United States Army account, General G. W. Goethals spent the bulk of her commissioned Navy service ferrying supplies for American forces in Europe to France and bringing home troops of the American Expeditionary Force who had served in Europe during World War I. She made a number of voyages to Europe with supplies, and brought home nearly 3,000 troops.
On 21 August 1919, General G. W. Goethals departed Charleston, South Carolina, carrying supplies to New Orleans, Louisiana; Cristóbal, Panama Canal Zone; and San Juan, Puerto Rico. She completed this voyage by arriving at New York City on 13 September 1919.
On the day of her arrival in New York, General G. W. Goethals was decommissioned and turned over to the United States Department of War for return to the Panama Railroad Steamship Company.


== Later career ==
The ship returned to commercial service as SS General G. W. Goethals.


=== Assistance to USS S-5 ===

On 2 September 1920, General G. W. Goethals was off Cape May, New Jersey, on a voyage from Haiti to New York City when the wooden steamship Alanthus contacted her at about 18:00 by the use of signal flags. Making her last voyage, Alanthus earlier in the day had come across the disabled U.S. Navy submarine USS S-5 (SS-110), which had sunk accidentally on 1 September 1920 during full-power trials off the Delaware Capes. The submarine's crew had partially refloated her, causing her to rise until only her stern broke the surface, but had been able to make only a tiny hole in her hull in their attempt to escape and remained trapped on board. Alanthus had rigged a pump to provide S-5's crew with air and had also provided the submarine's crew with fresh water and rigged cables to keep S-5's stern above water, but had been unable to help the crew enlarge the escape hole or, lacking a radio, to call for assistance until sighting General G. W. Goethals.General G. W. Goethals radioed the U.S. Navy with its first information about the submarine's plight and her crew immediately set about enlarging the escape hole. By 01:45 on 3 September 1920, the hole was big enough for S-5's crew to exit the submarine, and the last man to leave – S-5's commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Charles M. ""Savvy"" Cooke, Jr. – safely emerged from the escape hole at 03:00. Although her crew was safe, the submarine was lost later on 3 September when she sank while under tow by the battleship USS Ohio.The portion of S-5's hull plating that General G. W. Goethals removed to permit S-5's crew to escape from the submarine is on exhibit in the National Museum of the United States Navy in the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C.


=== Sale ===
On 10 January 1925, the Panama Railroad Steamship Company sold General G. W. Goethals to the Universal Negro Improvement Association.
In 1925 or 1926 she was sold to the Munson Steamship Line and renamed Munorleans. In 1929, she was operating on the New York–Brazil route.

== History ==
In 1930, NC Highway 115 was routed from the intersection of US 21 and US 64 in Statesville to the Wilkes-Iredell County line. By 1933, NC 115 was extended north to Old US 421/Speedway Rd, which was US 421 at the time. In 1941, was extended to the intersection of D Street and 10th Street in North Wilkesboro, which was then US 421 and NC 16. Around 1959, 115 got its first expansion to the south. NC 115 extended along US 21 and replaced 21 through Mooresville, Davidson, and Huntersville, ending at its current southern termini. Its most recent change was between 1969 and 1982 when NC 115 was shortened by 1.0 mile (1.6 km) to its current northern termini at D Street with NC 18 and 268.

== Works ==

He assisted Charles François de Mondion in the designs of Fort Manoel, and was responsible for major decorative additions at the palace of the Grand Master during the reign of Zondadari. He was involved in the decisions over the façade of the Church of St Catherine of the Italian Langue which was designed by Carrapecchia but disputed by then Capomastro Barbara - to later take his role as Capomastro delle Opere della Religione (the principal architect of the Order of St. John) in 1714. Together with Antonio Azzopardi, he oversaw the construction of the Manoel Theatre to designs of Romano Carapecchia in 1731–32.He was one of few local architects, along Bonici and Barbara, who took a leading role in changing the local attitude from the vernacular housing to an elegant European design.Zerafa was involved in several other public projects in the eighteenth century. Among which public works he designed windmills. In 1757 he designed the Castellania in Valletta, but he died on 21 April 1758 before the building was completed. He was succeeded as Capomastro delle Opere by Giuseppe Bonici, who oversaw the construction of the Castellania until it was completed in 1760.

It airs a Southern gospel music format with some Christian programming, according to the station's own web site.


== History ==


=== Early days ===
This station, as WPLH, signed on for the first time on November 29, 1946, with a ""grand opening"" program broadcast live from the Hotel Prichard in Huntington. WPLH transmitted at 1450 kHz with a 250 watt non-directional signal. The Huntington Broadcasting Corporation, owned and operated by Flem J. Evans, advertised broadcasting, recording and transcription services as being available at the WPLH studios. The station offered a mix of live and recorded local programming, live hillbilly music from the Echo Valley Boys and other groups, plus national programming from the Mutual Network. The callsign was said to stand for ""Work, Play, and Live in Huntington.""


=== Move to 1470 ===
In 1952, control of Huntington Broadcasting Corp. passed to E.A. Marshall until he was succeeded by Charles Krause in 1956. In 1955 the station changed broadcast frequencies from 1450 kHz to 1470 kHz. Struggling financially, the station was sold to The Tierney Company in 1958. The new owners downsized the staff and moved the studio facilities to a smaller location.
WPLH was sold again in 1960, this time to the Ohio River Broadcasting Corporation. The station's callsign was changed to WWHY, advertised as the ""Fun Channel"" and ""Home of the Flyin' HY Guys."" The new image was for the new format of pop hits and rock and roll. In the late-1960s and early-1970s WWHY was a power in the Tri-State area. The next two decades would see the station's format change several times and in the 1970s the callsign changed to WKSD (for ""Kan't Stop Dancing"" or ""Kool Sound of Disco"").


=== 1980s ===
In March 1981, the license for this station was involuntarily transferred to Leo J. Meisel, interim trustee, after the station's owner fell into serious financial difficulties. The transfer was approved by the FCC on March 27, 1981, and the transaction was completed on April 22, 1981. This station was reassigned its former call letters WWHY by the Federal Communications Commission on July 9, 1981.In September 1985, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation filed to force Meisel to transfer the license to the FDIC. In March 1987, Meisel reached an agreement to instead donate the license for this station to the Marshall University Foundation, Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on June 17, 1987, and the transaction was consummated on July 2, 1987. This transfer, arranged as part of a settlement agreement with the FDIC, caused the FDIC to drop its claim and the FCC to dismiss the transfer request. On July 10, 1987, the new owners had the station's call letters changed to WHRD to match the Marshall University sports nickname, the ""Thundering Herd.""


=== 1990s ===
In July 1991, the Marshall University Foundation, Inc., reached an agreement to sell this station to Southern Communications Corporation. The deal was approved by the FCC on August 27, 1991, and the transaction was consummated on October 23, 1991.In February 1995, Southern Communications Corporation signed a deal to sell this station to Simmons Broadcasting Company. The deal was approved by the FCC on April 11, 1995, and the transaction was consummated on May 20, 1995. In April 1997, control of station licensee Simmons Broadcasting Company was passed from David L. Simmons to W. Lee Simmons. This transfer was approved by the FCC on June 27, 1997.


=== 2000s ===
In November 2000, Simmons Broadcasting Company (Lee Simmons, president) completed a deal to sell this station to Concord Media Group, Inc. (Mark W. Jorgenson, president/owner) for a reported $200,000. The deal was approved by the FCC on January 17, 2001, and the transaction was consummated on February 16, 2001. At the time of the sale, the station aired a sports radio format.In May 2003, Concord Media Group, Inc., agreed to sell this station to Mortenson Broadcasting through their Mortenson Broadcasting Company of West Virginia, LLC, holding company. The deal was approved by the FCC on November 12, 2003, and the transaction was consummated on January 30, 2004. The weekend of January 30, the station played TV show theme songs in a ""Stunting effort"" to attract listeners. On Monday February 2, the station debuted their short lived ""Christian Talk format"". On February 9, 2004, the new owners had the FCC change this station's callsign to WEMM to match its new FM sister station (which itself was changed from WEMM to WEMM-FM at the same time). From late February 2004 to September 2008, served as a simulcast partner to sister station WEMM-FM (107.9 FM).


=== Move to 1200 ===

Based on applications filed in January 2004 and November 2005, the FCC granted this station a construction permit on October 25, 2007, to change broadcast frequencies from 1470 kHz to 1200 kHz, increase daytime signal power to 22,000 watts, change critical hours signal power to 8,000 watts, and decrease nighttime signal power to just 9 watts. The low nighttime power is required to protect the signal of clear channel AM WOAI in San Antonio, Texas, which also broadcasts at 1200 kHz.The station was assigned the WRWB call letters by the FCC on September 1, 2008.


=== 2010s ===
The call sign was changed again to WNBL on November 1, 2010, to match the station's ""Better Life Radio"" branding. As WNBL, the station played music on weekdays with educational and inspirational programs on Saturday plus religious programs on Sunday. After construction and testing were completed in January 2011, the station received a new broadcast license for the new 1200 kHz frequency on February 8, 2011.The call sign was reverted to WEMM and the station was rebranded as ""Shine 1200"" on December 20, 2011. The new format is Gospel Music.
On July 2, 2015, WEMM changed their call letters to WZPS and rebranded as ""Spirit 1200"". On January 3, 2017, WZPS changed their call letters to WYSN.

== History ==


=== Early developments ===
In mid 2016, Anex Tourism Group, yet engaged especially in Russian leisure market and operating airlines both in Russia (Azur Air Russia) und Ukraine (Azur Air Ukraine), founded a German subsidiary in Düsseldorf and started distribution for 2017 travel season in late 2016. The AOC for its German carrier was requested simultaneously. First flights are scheduled to start in April 2017. Beside its home base at Düsseldorf Airport, where the fleet will also be maintained, Azur Air planned to operate from Berlin-Schönefeld and Munich. At the beginning, Azur Air flew to Mediterranean destinations and the Caribbean for Anex Tour only.
At first, Azur Air was to receive three Boeing 767-300ER from sister company Azur Air from Russia. The fleet was planned to be enhanced by Boeing 737 and 757s later on while destination network would be expanded. Operations were firstly planned to start in spring 2017, but have been shifted towards summer 2017. Azur Air then received its AOC and commenced operations a few days later on 4 July.
During summer 2017, Azur Air announced it would increase its long-haul operations by offering more flights to Punta Cana from its existing departure airports Berlin-Schönefeld and Düsseldorf as well as starting the destination from several more German cities such as Hannover.


=== Demise ===
In March 2018, Azur Air announced it would replace two of its three Boeing 767-300ER, which were handed to sister company Azur Air Ukraine, by two smaller Boeing 737-900s.In July 2018, Azur Air Germany announced major changes to its operations due to insufficient business figures. While the last remaining Boeing 767, which was then already leased out to Azur Air Ukraine, was to be transferred to Azur Air in Russia by October 2018, Azur Air Germany was to continue its operations with only one remaining aircraft without any long-haul services. In the same time, the entire station in Berlin was to be shut down, laying off 90 staff.In September 2018, Azur Air Germany sparked controversy amongst its employees after the relocation of its sole remaining aircraft to other operations while the flights from Germany have been taken over by leasing contractors on short notice. On 26 September 2018, it has been announced that the airline ceased all operations with immediate effect and will be dissolved due to a negative business outlook. Prior to this, the owners tried to sell the airline's operational license without success.

Community Structure Theory,['Mass media theories'],"Community structure theory provides a powerful framework for analyzing society's influence on media coverage. It has been identified by Funk and McCombs (2015) as the “conceptual inverse” of agenda-setting, focusing on demographic characteristics of communities shaping news instead of news as a driver of public perception. For example, community structure theory has found repeated links between indicators of vulnerability (such as unemployment levels, poverty levels, crime rate, etc.) and favorable coverage of critical US national issues such as immigration reform or universal health care. Further, in cross-national studies comparing national characteristics and reporting on human trafficking, HIV/AIDS treatment access, water handling/contamination, and child labor, media coverage varied significantly with levels of ""female empowerment""— female literacy rate, female child life expectancy, and female school life expectancy.","Community structure theory provides a powerful framework for analyzing society's influence on media coverage.

Further, in cross-national studies comparing national characteristics and reporting on human trafficking, HIV/AIDS treatment access, water handling/contamination, and child labor, media coverage varied significantly with levels of ""female empowerment""— female literacy rate, female child life expectancy, and female school life expectancy.


== Early influences ==
The modern community structure model originated with the work of University of Chicago's Robert Park, who in The Immigrant Press and Its Control  first suggested society could influence media. Morris Janowitz  later introduced the concept that press coverage could serve as an index of the social structure and values of distinct communities. Janowitz employed multiple methodologies for his research, including reader surveys, in-depth interviews with journalists, and content analysis of 82 different community newspapers in the Chicago area.
Tichenor, Donohue and Olien evolved Park's and Janowitz's work with their concept of structural pluralism, finding differences between newspaper reporting in smaller, relatively homogeneous metropolitan areas and that in larger, more demographically diverse areas, the latter manifesting more progressive coverage. These University of Minnesota theorists later developed the “guard dog” hypothesis, emphasizing the “social control” role of media, whereby local media function less as watchdogs and more as guard dogs protecting the interests of powerful, elite members of society.Other scholars in the late 90s (Hindman, 1999; Demers & Viswanath, 1999; McLeod and Hertog, 1999) also recognized a connection between mass media coverage and community characteristics, but emphasized the role of media less as mechanisms for social control than for social change. When Hindman compared media coverage in large vs. small ethic populations, he found a difference in how similar stories were covered based on the relative size of ethnic groups in communities. Similarly, McLeod and Hertog (1999) found news media covered protest mobilizations more favorably in communities with a greater numbers of protesters. Demers and Viswanath (1999) enhanced previous structural findings by exploring the role of media as agents of both social control and social change.
With the introduction of digital tools for analyzing media texts, the community structure model or approach was successfully expanded, tested, and used to study systematic news reports of critical events in communities across the nation and throughout the world by John C. Pollock, who began identifying this work as “Community Structure” research.


== Contemporary applications ==
Pollock and coauthors made three key contributions to community structure theory. First, they conducted among the first US nationwide and cross-national studies using the community structure model, comparing multiple large metropolitan areas and countries, expanding study sample sizes beyond a focus on one or two cities. Second, Pollock et al. also evolved the theory to include a Media Vector methodological tool for measuring both content direction and editorial prominence of articles, then combining them into a single score, thereby adding a way to consider editorial evaluation as well as article content. Third, Pollock and coauthor findings often challenged the traditional “guard dog” hypothesis by concluding that media can often reflect the interests of more vulnerable stakeholders. Community structure studies are related to work focusing on the roles of social capital (in political science and sociology literatures) and social determinants of health (in health communication and public health literatures) and social ecological models (in sociology and public health). In 2008, Pollock authored the entry on the ""Community Structure model"" for the International Encyclopedia of Communication, and in 2013, he authored an authoritative annotated bibliography on Community Structure scholarship for Oxford Bibliographies Online.

","Burauen (IPA: [bu'ɾaʊen]), officially the Municipality of Burauen (Waray: Bungto han Burauen; Tagalog: Bayan ng Burauen), is a 1st class municipality in the province of Leyte, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 52,511 people. 


== Etymology ==
The name “Burauen” evolved from the word “haru” which means “spring”. This is because Burauen is the fountainhead of several rivers: the big Daguitan and Marabong rivers, the Guinarona and Hibuga rivers that pass through several neighboring towns, as well as several smaller ones. The legend behind the name speaks of a drought when several tributaries of these rivers dried up, forcing people to flock to a cluster of large springs in the town. The place was duly called “Buraburon” which according to Justice Norberto Lopez Romualdez Sr., is the “multiplicative construction of the word “haru” (spring), which indicates “abundance”. Over the years, the name “Buraburon” (“having many springs”) evolved into “Burawon” and finally into “Burawen”.


== History ==


=== Early Settlers ===
Clandestine diggings conducted by antique hunters and verified by the National Museum archaeologists yield valuable artifacts consisting of chinaware and jars. Some of the discoveries were Stone Age artifacts and implements.  These antiques and artifacts were found on the plateaus of both sides of the Kag-oloolo Brook of Barangay Patag and Villa Aurora, which were about 16 kilometers southwest of the poblacion of Burauen. Similar artifacts were found in Barangay Paghudlan which is 12 kilometers from the Kag-oloolo. The earlier diggings on the south western portion of the poblacion, and those in Barangay Tambuco and Armasen unearth several precious antiques.  With the extensive presence of these artifacts over the said areas, the past locations of the early settlements in Burauen during the prehistoric epoch are indicated.


=== Spanish Regime ===
The Jesuit Friars discovered Burauen as settlement in the later part of 1595 when they used the community as a base in the Christianization of the central part of Leyte.  Between years 1609 to 1616 Burauen was the most populous town of Leyte and Samar and it consistently registered the highest tax collection during the same period in the region. From Buraburon, the settlers were told by the Jesuit Missionaries to transfer to “Armasen” (meaning a trading place that is at the same time a granary), presently a sitio of Barangay Libas, which was similarly named today. Due to frequent flooding of the area by the Guinarona River, and to facilitate their “reducción de las visitas”, they transferred to the site of the present Barangay Malabca and led by Tamdon and his brother Hangdon who were the children of the last Rajah.


=== Filipino - American War ===

The short-lived Philippine Republic proclaimed on June 12, 1898, face a new enemy, the American who were pursuing their so-called “Manifest Destiny” The troops of the Revolutionary Army under General Ambrosio Mojica, realizing that their fortification of “estacas” (bamboo palisades) around the poblacion of Burauen were weak, they force to withdraw to the mountains.  Several encounters occur during the Filipino-American War, the American burned the poblacion on July 4, 1900, sparing only the Catholic Church, its convent, the warehouses and the building of the Smith Bell and Co. and Chinese merchandizing.  This incident made Burauen one of the strongholds of the “Pulahan” dissidents.
With the cessation of hostilities, the people devoted their efforts to the reconstruction of their homes and expansion of their farms to usher progress of the municipality.  The productive endeavors of the people lured many enterprises to the town. The first Electric System and cinematographic house in Leyte and Samar were established in Burauen in 1916.  In 1928 Burauen Academy, the first secondary school in the municipality was founded. The different municipal administrations of the time were able to put up irrigation system in 1912. Constructed a big public market in 1918, erect a concrete municipal building in 1925 and build concrete school building in 1928. the income of the municipality in 1918 to 1928 was bigger than the income of the whole province of Surigao, this due to the wide area of abacá plantation of that time. This boomtown prosperity of Burauen lasted until 1929 when the great depression took place.


=== World War II ===
The outbreak of World War II stunted the economic growth of Burauen. The Japanese Military encamped the eastern part of the poblacion there were many encounters between the Japanese forces and the guerillas who were firmly establish in their mountain strongholds. During the Allied Forces liberation of Leyte on October 20, 1944, Burauen was among the most heavily devastated towns in Leyte, thousands of civilians were killed and a number of properties were destroyed.


=== Post War Period to Present ===
Rising from the ruins of war, the municipality rehabilitated its homes and agriculture, hand in hand with the improvement of its institution and facilities.  In 1946, the Burauen High School was founded, followed by the rehabilitation of the Gabaldon School Building, and the construction and operation of the water system in 1948.  The private sector contributed in the field of education in 1950 the Burauen Institute and the Rizal Colleges were founded.  The progress of the town suffered a setback in the middle part of 1951 when a very strong typhoon hit Burauen, which was followed by four others that were equally ravaging.  In 1952, despite financial hardships, the municipal government was able to repair the municipal building from its own funds but generally, the recovery of the municipality was very slow. On March 2, 1962, the Rural Bank of Burauen was established, the first rural bank in Leyte and Samar. A decade after, on April 1, 1972, the Burauen District Hospital was opened to accept its first patient.  During the intervening years and onward, road and bridges construction and street concreting in the poblacion and the Barangays alike were pursued, together with the construction of school building and health centers.  The public market area as well as the irrigation system was expanded.


=== Timeline ===
In 1873, from being a missionary church under the diocese of Dagami, Burauen was carved out and declared as a separate town.
In 1918, La Paz detached itself from Burauen to become an independent municipality.
In 1949, or just a few years after world war 2, President Elpidio Quirino issued an executive order no.278 separating Julita from burauen.
It was on March 2, 1962 when the Rural Bank of Burauen was established. Making it the very first rural bank in both islands of Samar and Leyte.
When a German ethnologist and explorer came to Burauen in 1859 to 1860, he witnessed how sulfur was extracted, processed using coconut oil, and transported to Manila, where it was sold between 1 and 5 dollars per PICO. But the sulfur discovery was already reported 200 years earlier, in 1961, by a jesuit priest named Fr. Francisco Combes.

Notable persons supporting the initiative are former actress and UN Sustainable Development Goals Advocate Antoinette Taus, former Tourism Secretary Mina Gabor, and Asean Center for Biodiversity Director Mundita Lim.


=== Attractions ===
Mahagnao Volcano Natural Park
Burauen's upland territories are composed of wetland forests that contain thousands of century old trees, unique species of birds and mammals, plants and marine species mostly scattered inside Mahagnao Volcano Natural Park. It is also has with many natural sites such as lakes, mountain ranges, rivers, waterfalls, hot springs and a volcano. MVNP has an elevation of 1,200 meters above sea level and an area of 635 hectares, within the boundaries of Burauen, La Paz and McArthur towns.
Mahagnao Volcano
Mahagnao Volcano is a dormant volcano located in Barangay Mahagnao, more than 30 km away from the town proper. Although the volcano has been inactive, it is still classified as potentially active due to the active thermal features of the mountain. Tourist are allowed to hike on its peak.
Malagsum Lake
This lake is smaller compared to the other one. It is a highly acidic lake which contains high level of sulfuric acid making it impossible for marine lives or some organisms to thrive. Except for the hundreds to thousands of wild docks making it as breeding ground or a home for migratory birds during migrating season.Mahagnao Lake
This lake serves as the main source of marine products for the locals and also the center of its tourism activities. Several resorts owned privately or by community associations are on the lakeshore.Matigbao Lake
It is the smallest of the three lakes inside the park. But it is also the farthest and the most challenging to have a trek.
Due to being isolated, the environment is quite different from what commonly seen in the rest of the park. There are numerous species of plants and insects thriving within the vicinity (such as dragonflies).Calor Hot spring
The spring is just located at the southern foot of the volcano. It was a system of springs heated by an active thermal feature. Thus, creating a hot spring that merges to another system of spring creating a river of hot spring.Guin-aniban Falls
The waterfall is located few kilometers on the southeast. It is the water from the Mahagnao lake which is passing to systems of rivers then merge before approaching on the mouth of the cliff creating a water fall that directly flow on the larger river called Marabong.


== Religion ==
Like the Philippines as a whole, Burauen is also a predominantly Catholic town that traces its origin way back during the early period of Spanish Colonialism.
It all started when the Jesuits arrived in the Philippines in 1590, they came to Leyte and established a temporary residence in Dulag in 1595, and another residencia in Dagami in 1613 which became one of the two Jesuit residences in Leyte, the other being Carigara. The Dulag rector Fr. Pascual de Acuña started apostolic work in Burauen in 1622 (Redondo, 1886). It seemed to have been an embryonic missionary outpost for so many years because Fr. Francisco Colins wrote in 1663 that Dagami had only ten villages with their own churches. Burauen was not one of them.
A 1767 Royal Decree ceded Burauen from the Jesuits to the Augustinian Recollects when the former was expelled in the Philippines in 1768. The Jesuits’ possessions were forfeited except for the obras pias. “The Diocese of Cebu (which had jurisdiction over Leyte-Samar) refused to recognize the Jesuits' mission-pueblos as parishes even if the pueblos had functioned as parishes, some for at least a century,” says Leyte-Samar historian Rolando Borrinaga.
""I assume this would have been the time that Burauen’s pueblo-mission status was demoted to a visita of Dulag, because at that time, Burauen was already a pueblo with its own parish priest"" (Borrinaga, 2020). The oldest entries in Burauen's records date back to June 3, 1804, during the time of Augustinian Fr. Pedro Gomez as parish priest (Redondo, 1886).
In his Estado Geografico published in 1865, the Franciscan friar Fr. Felix Huerta wrote that Burauen formally separated from its mother parish in Dulag in 1844 with Fr. Francisco Lopez as its parish priest. Given the rivalry between the Jesuits and the Franciscans (and the alliance of Augustinians and Franciscans), Fr. Huerta, like the Diocese of Cebu, did not seem to acknowledge Burauen as a Jesuits’ pueblo-mission.
From the river, Fr. Lopez oversaw the transfer and construction of a new Augustinian-led church to a new site (presumably at the present-day location) made of hardwood posts with double paneling of planks and nipa roofing 186 ft. long and 48 ft. wide. With Burauen right smack on a typhoon path, the structure would not survive long.
Currently, the under construction new Burauen, Leyte Immaculate Conception Catholic church is slowly taking shape. Once finished, the church would be of a neo-gothic design, which features geometric decorative designs and decorative blocks.

East Coweta High School was founded on April 17, 1946 when the Coweta County School Board ordered that the Haralson, Raymond, Starr, and Senoia school operate East Coweta High School at Starr School for the ensuing year. This resulted from a series of consolidations begun years earlier. In the fall of 1988, the high school students of Moreland, East Newnan, White Oak, Major, the traditional East Coweta area, and all parts in between merged to culminate the consolidation efforts begun so long ago.


=== Other consolidations ===
These major consolidated schools ultimately resulted in the present East Coweta High School.

Preston Academy - Preston Hall houses the Main Office, Guidance Office, and Attendance Office. Preston Academy was the oldest documented school in East Coweta County (1827?-1884).

","The Fick Observatory was an astronomical observatory owned and operated by Iowa State University. Located southwest of Boone, Iowa it was named after Davenport, Iowa amateur astronomer Erwin W. Fick. The observatory closed in 2015.


== History ==
Iowa State University’s original telescope and observatory, located northwest of Ames, was donated by the family of Milo Mather of Clarksville, Iowa, following his death in 1960.  Mather was an accomplished amateur astronomer and mechanical engineering graduate (1907) of Iowa State.  In 1970, the mirror from his telescope was reconditioned and used in a newly reconfigured telescope, also named after Mather, and installed in the Erwin W. Fick Observatory.
Iowa State built the Fick Observatory southwest of Boone, Iowa, in 1970. The facility was named after Erwin W. Fick (1897–1975), an amateur astronomer and retired member of the U.S. Corps of Engineers from Davenport, Iowa. Though Fick had never been to Ames, let alone graduated from Iowa State, he set up a trust through the ISU Foundation to help support Iowa State’s observatory. New imaging devices, such as the CCD (charge-coupled device) camera installed in 1990, and the short focal length of the telescope allowed researchers to obtain wide-field views of the sky to very faint limits. Measurements gathered by the Mather telescope could be used to complement data obtained by larger observatories, which often sacrifice wide views for fine detail. Over the years, Iowa State researchers used the Fick Observatory for a wide variety of studies, including stellar radial velocity observations, studies of ring galaxy collisions, and lunar occultation studies.In 2015, the Erwin W. Fick Observatory closed.  It was the last astronomical research observatory operated by a college or university at a dark-sky site in the state of Iowa.On April 1st, 2020, the Observatory and surrounding land (45.31 acres) was sold to Aaron Gillett for the price of $339,870.31 sadly closing the observatory for good.

== Biography ==
Upon the death of his uncle, James Butler, 3rd Marquess of Ormonde, Lord Ossory (as he was known after his uncle's death) inherited the family seat of Kilkenny Castle and several other estates traditionally owned by the Marquess of Ormonde. This was made in an attempt to avoid burdening the Estate with death duties for both the 3rd and 4th Marquesses. His father, the 4th Marquess, was supported by the independent wealth of his American wife, Ellen Stager.
The last member of the family to live there, Lord Ossory (as he was known as the time) and his family left Kilkenny Castle in 1935 and resided in London. The contents of the castle were sold in 1935 and the castle left neglected.George Butler, 5th Marquess of Ormonde died on 21 June 1949. His estate was valued at £26884.


== Marriage and descendants ==
He married Hon. Sybil Inna Mildred Fellowes, daughter of William Henry Fellowes, 2nd Baron de Ramsey and Lady Rosamond Fellowes, Baroness de Ramsey, on 23 February 1915. They had two children:
James Anthony Butler, Viscount Thurles (1916–1940), died unmarried serving in Second World War as Driver, Royal Army Service Corps
Lady Moyra Rosamond Butler (1920–1959) married (1) Charles Weld-Forester and (2) Count Guy van den Steen de Jehay.

Gerard van den Steen (b. 1949) (m. Patricia Delloye)
Moyra van den Steen
Ségolène van den Steen
Géraldine van den SteenLady Ormonde's mother, Lady Rosamond Spencer-Churchill was the daughter of John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough, the aunt of Charles Spencer-Churchill, 9th Duke of Marlborough (who was married to the most famous of the American 'Dollar Princesses', Consuelo Vanderbilt) and the sister of Lord Randolph Churchill, father of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Lady Ormonde was therefore the first cousin of Winston Churchill.Butler fought and was wounded in the First World War. His only son predeceased him during the Second, so he was succeeded by his brother James Butler, 6th Marquess of Ormonde.
Lady Moyra married, firstly, Charles Weld-Forester (who was the son on Major Hon. Edric Weld-Forester (who in turn was the son of the 5th Baron Forester of Willey Park) and Lady Victoria Wynn-Carington (who was the daughter of the 1st Marquess of Lincolnshire and a Lady-in-Waiting to Mary of Teck) on 20 April 1940. They had one son, Piers Edric Weld-Forester. The couple were divorced in 1948, and on 3 August of the same year she married Count Guy Jacques van den Steen de Jehay, a Belgian nobleman.
Lord Ormonde's descendants include two grandsons and three great-granddaughters. His elder grandson Piers Weld-Forester was a prominent figure in London society in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Described as a 'playboy in the true sense of the word', he was briefly the boyfriend of Princess Anne in 1971 and went on to become a motor-cycle racer. He was killed in a motorcycle crash in 1977. During his lifetime, Piers was one of the last remaining male members of the Butler Dynasty, along with his great-uncle Arthur Butler, 6th Marquess of Ormonde and first cousin twice-removed Charles Butler, 7th Marquess of Ormonde. Upon the transfer of the family's ancestral home Kilkenny Castle to the local government in 1967, the remainder of the Ormonde Family Trust was wound up and split equally between the 6th Marquess, Charles Butler (later 7th Marquess) and Piers.

== Critical reception ==
Stephen King listed The Opener of the Way as one of Arkham House's ""most important works"". Stephen Jones and Kim Newman included the collection in Horror: Another 100 Best Books, with Joel Lang noting that it demonstrated Bloch's ""meteoric development from faux-Gothic pastiche to sour, elliptical portraits of urban damnation"". Don D'Ammassa stated that ""Although some of the stories are crude by [Bloch's] later standards, there is a raw power to many of them that has ensured their continued popularity"".


== Trivia ==
The creators of the game Half-Life 2 reference Bloch's work: the central villain, Dr. Wallace Breen refers to the player's character, Gordon Freeman in a televised speech saying ""And yet, unsophisticated minds continue to imbue him with romantic power, giving him such dangerous poetic labels as 'the one free man, the opener of the way.'""
The Dungeons and Dragons Role-playing game features (in the third Monster Manual) a creature called Allabar, Opener of the Way.

It is located on a rocky hill c. 400 m over the sea level and is part of the Amalfi Coast.


== History ==
According to an ancient and unproven tradition, it was founded by Roman shipwrecks travelling to Constantinople. In the Middle Ages Scala was, together with Ravello, the most important fortification of the Duchy of Amalfi. Its two castles (mentioned in a document of c. 1000 AD) were sacked by Robert Guiscard in 1073 and destroyed by the Pisane sixty years later. In 1210 the fate repeated with the troops of Otto IV and, in the late century, during the Sicilian Vespers.
The Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer, commonly known as the Redemptorists, were founded in Scala by Saint Alphonsus Maria de' Liguori.


== Main sights ==
Scala is divided into six different hamlets with precise identities: from north to south, Santa Caterina, Campoleone, Campidoglio, Scala, Minuta and Pontone. Attractions include:

Santa Caterina: Porta Urbana, church of Santa Caterina, chapels of St. Paul and Santa Maria della Porta
Campoleone: church of San Pietro, in Angevine-Gothic style.
Campidoglio: church of San Giovanni Battista, with a Moresque bell tower.
The Duomo of Scala, modified in Baroque times. It has maintained the medieval crypt, the Angevine sepulchre of Marinella Rufolo, and an episcopal mitre and a Crucifix from the 13th century. Also notable is the Bishops' Palace.
Minuta: Romanesque church of Annunziata
Pontone: church of San Giovanni Battista and the remains of the basilica of Sant'Eustachio.
Hotel Zi'Ntonio: charming hotel with balconies in every room directly overlooking the Amalfi coast and a beautiful view of Ravello. The experience feels like a scene from the movie A Room With a View.


== Chestnuts ==
The town is famous for its cultivation of chestnuts.  Every year, at the end of November, for two consecutive weekends, a Sagra delle Castagne (a chestnut festival) is held in the main square.

== History ==


=== Early period ===

From the beginning of the 19th century, it is worth mentioning that under the reign of Ferdinand VII, the work of promoting agriculture were carried out by the Ministry of Finance or the field of livestock, under the authority of the Council of the Mesta.The Royal Decree of 9 November 1832 created the Secretariat of State and the Dispatch of General Development of the Realm and which had among its responsibilities the promotion of agriculture, nurseries and breeding cattle, gardening and conservation of mountains and trees or hunting and fishing. For this, it was made dependent on the Ministry the Department for Forestry Conservation and the Honorable Council of the Mesta.The agriculture responsibilities remained in the Ministry of Development for nearly one hundred years. In 1870 there was already a Directorate-General for Public Works and Agriculture.Finally, in 1900, after the split of Education, the Development Ministry was suppressed and the Ministry of Agriculture, Industry, Commerce and Public Works was created to assume the rest of the responsibilities. However, five years later the Ministry of Agriculture is suppressed and the Ministry of Development recovered.With the approval of Royal Decree of 3 November 1928, the Ministry of National Economy was created, to which the Directorate-General for Agriculture was transferred along with the agricultural chambers, the agronomic council and the association of Cattle Ranchers and the services of Hygiene and Livestock Health.


=== Late period ===
By Decree of 16 December 1931, the President of the Republic Niceto Alcalá Zamora re-created the Ministry, incorporating the Directorate-General for Agriculture, Industry and Commerce, from the Ministry of National Economy, and the Directorate-General for Mines and Fuels, the Directorate-General for Forestry, Fishing and Hunting and the Directorate-General for Livestock, from the Ministry of Development.As happened with the Ministry of Development, in 1933 the Ministry was divided into two: the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. It was the first time that there was a Ministry dedicated exclusively to managing the agricultural affairs. The separation became final, except in the period from 25 September 1935 to 19 February 1936, when it assumed again the responsibilities of industry and trade.
The next big change would be made in 1981, when the ministry assumed the competencies on fisheries and was called Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food until 2008 when prime minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero merged it with the Environment Ministry and was renamed Ministry of the Environment and Rural and Marine Affairs.
The new government of Mariano Rajoy renamed the department in 2011 as Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment and since 2016 as Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, Food and Environment. In 2018, new prime minister Pedro Sánchez created again the Ministry of Environment and this ministry recovered the 1981-2008 denomination. In 2020, the ministry lost its powers on forestry.


== Structure ==
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is organised in the following bodies:The General Secretariat for Agriculture and Food
The Directorate-General for Agricultural Production and Markets
The Directorate-General for Health of Agricultural Production
The Directorate-General for Rural Development, Innovation and Agrifood Training
The Directorate-General for the Food Industry
The Deputy Directorate-General for Support and Coordination

Faunus revealed the future in dreams and voices that were communicated to those who came to sleep in his precincts, lying on the fleeces of sacrificed lambs. W. Warde Fowler suggested that Faunus is identical with Favonius, one of the Roman wind gods (compare the Anemoi).


== Etymology ==
The name Faunus is generally thought to stem from Proto-Italic *fawe or *fawono (variant *fawōn(jo)), thus being cognate with Umbrian fons, foner ('merciful'). It may ultimately derive from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) *bʰh₂u-n ('favourable'), which also reflects Old Irish búan ('good, favourable, firm') and Middle Welsh bun ('maiden, sweetheart').Another theory contends that Faunus is the Latin outcome of PIE *dhau-no- ('the strangler', thus denoting the 'wolf'), a proposition suggested by the fact that the Luperci (from Latin lupus, 'wolf') are commonly associated with the god Faunus.


== Origin ==
Faunus may be of Indo-European origin and related to the Vedic god Rudra. It is believed that he was worshipped by traditional Roman farmers before becoming a nature deity.


== Consorts and family ==

In fable Faunus appears as an old king of Latium, grandson of Saturnus, son of Picus, and father of Latinus by the nymph Marica (who was also sometimes Faunus' mother). After his death he is raised to the position of a tutelary deity of the land, for his many services to agriculture and cattle-breeding.
A goddess of like attributes, called Fauna and Fatua, was associated in his worship. She was regarded as his daughter, wife, or sister. The female deity Bona Dea was often equated with Fauna.
As Pan was accompanied by the Paniskoi, or little Pans, so the existence of many Fauni was assumed besides the chief Faunus. Fauns are place-spirits (genii) of untamed woodland. Educated, Hellenizing Romans connected their fauns with the Greek satyrs, who were wild and orgiastic drunken followers of Dionysus, with a distinct origin.


== Equivalence with Pan ==
With the increasing influence of Greek mythology on Roman mythology in the 3rd and 2nd–centuries BC, the Romans identified their own deities with Greek ones in what was called interpretatio romana. Faunus was naturally equated with the god Pan, who was a pastoral god of shepherds who was said to reside in Arcadia. Pan had always been depicted with horns and as such many depictions of Faunus also began to display this trait. However, the two deities were also considered separate by many, for instance, the epic poet Virgil, in his Aeneid, made mention of both Faunus and Pan independently.


== Festivals ==
In Justin's epitome, Faunus is identified with Lupercus (""he who wards off the wolf""), otherwise a priest of Faunus. Livy named Inuus as the god originally worshiped at the Lupercalia, 15 February, when his priests (Luperci) wore goat-skins and hit passers-by with goatskin whips.
Two festivals, called Faunalia, were celebrated in his honour—one on 13 February, in the temple of Faunus on the island in the Tiber, the other on 5 December, when the peasants brought him rustic offerings and amused themselves with dancing.A euhemeristic account made Faunus a Latin king, son of Picus and Canens. He was then revered as the god Fatuus after his death, worshipped in a sacred forest outside what is now Tivoli, but had been known since Etruscan times as Tibur, the seat of the Tiburtine Sibyl. His numinous presence was recognized by wolf skins, with wreaths and goblets.
In Nonnos' Dionysiaca, Faunus/Phaunos accompanied Dionysus when the god campaigned in India.


== Later worship ==

Faunus was worshipped across the Roman Empire for many centuries. An example of this was a set of thirty-two 4th-century spoons found near Thetford in England in 1979. They had been engraved with the name ""Faunus"", and each had a different epithet after the god's name. The spoons also bore Christian symbols, and it has been suggested that these were initially Christian but later taken and devoted to Faunus by pagans. The 4th century was a time of large scale Christianisation, and the discovery provides evidence that even during the decline of traditional Roman religion, the god Faunus was still worshipped.In Gaul, Faunus was identified with the Celtic Dusios.

== Description ==
Despite its size and the somewhat doubtful mutual relationships, this family is rather uniform and easily recognizable.
Most are herbaceous annuals or perennials, dying off above ground each year. A few species are shrubs or small trees, such as some Acanthophyllum species. Most plants are non-succulent; i.e. having no fleshy stems or leaves. The nodes on the stem are swollen. The leaves are almost always opposite, rarely whorled. The blades are entire, petiolate, and often stipulate. These stipules are not sheath-forming.
The hermaphroditic flowers are terminal, blooming singly or branched or forked in cymes. The inflorescence is usually dichasial at least in the lower parts, which means that in the axil of each peduncle (primary flower stalk) of the terminal flower in the cyme, two new single-flower branches sprout up on each side of and below the first flower. If the terminal flowers are absent, then this can lead to monochasia, i.e. a monoparous cyme with a single flower on each axis of the inflorescence. In the extreme, this leads to a single flower, such as in Githago or Arenaria. The flowers are regular and mostly with five petals and five sepals, but sometimes with four petals. The sepals may be free from one another or united. The petals may be entire, fringed or deeply cleft. The calyx may be cylindrically inflated, as in Silene. The stamens number five or 10 (or more rarely four or eight), and are mostly isomerous with the perianth. The superior gynoecium has two to five carpels (members of a compound pistil) and is syncarpous; i.e. with these carpels united in a compound ovary. This ovary has one chamber inside the ovary. The fruit may be a utricle with a single seed or a capsule containing several seeds.


== Systematics ==

Currently, Amaranthaceae and Caryophyllaceae are sister groups and considered closely related.
Formerly, Caryophyllaceae were considered the sister family to all of the remaining members of the suborder Caryophyllineae because they have anthocyanins, and not betalain pigments. However, cladistic analyses indicate Caryophyllaceae evolved from ancestors that contained betalain, reinforcing betalain as an accurate synapomorphy of the suborder.This family is traditionally divided in three subfamilies:

Alsinoideae: no stipules, petals not united
Silenoideae: no stipules, petals united
Paronychioideae: fleshy stipules, petals separate or unitedThe last, however, are a basal grade of rather primitive members of this family, not closely related, but simply retaining many plesiomorphic traits. Instead of a subfamily, most ought to be treated as genera incertae sedis, but Corrigiola and Telephium might warrant recognition as Corrigioleae. The Alsinoideae, on the other hand, seem to form two distinct clades, perhaps less some misplaced genera. Finally, the Silenoideae appear monophyletic at least for the most part, if some of the taxa misplaced in Alsinoideae are moved there; it may be that the name Caryophylloideae would apply for the revised delimitation.However, hybridization between many members of this family is rampant—particularly in the Silenoideae/Caryophylloideae—and some of the lineages of descent have been found to be highly complicated and do not readily yield to cladistic analysis.

Octavius Hicks,"['1852 births', '1930 deaths', 'Articles with short description', 'CS1: Julian–Gregorian uncertainty', 'Canadian people of Ulster-Scottish descent', 'People from Etobicoke', 'Scottish emigrants to Canada', 'Short description matches Wikidata']","Octavius Laing Hicks (27 January 1852 – 23 December 1930) was a prominent citizen of Humber Bay in Etobicoke Township. He was born in Dundee, Scotland. He settled in Humber Bay in 1873 and remained there for the rest of his life.He is best known as a builder of boats and bridges. His contracting business constructed bridges, and foundations. He was also an inventor, hotel owner, and brickmaker.
His best known patent was a sliding seat for racing sculls. He also patented a boat rudder which could be easily shipped or unshipped. 'The Flotilla' carousel formed from a ring of miniature boats was installed at  High Park in 1894. In 1899, it was moved to Munro Park in eastern Toronto. His boathouse was on the Humber River, south of Lakeshore Road. Boats were built and rented at this location. Hicks saved several people from drowning. He once rented boats to the party of Governor General Lansdowne. In 1918, his boat livery became involved in legal dispute with the Toronto Board of Harbor Commissioners. The Board claimed jurisdiction over the Humber River, but Hicks disputed this. He managed to obtain the support of the York County Commissioners. Hicks took the matter to court but lost quickly because ""the limits were set by the Department of Marine and Fisheries at Ottawa, and were not merely plan of the commissioners.""In 1873, he built a boathouse on the Humber River between Lakeshore Road and the G.T.R. tracks. The Royal Oak Hotel was located a little west. He purchased it from the widow of the hotel's builder in 1880. As a hotelier, he sometimes joined with owners of nearby hotels to jointly promote their businesses. Most ambitious was when he joined with John Duck (Wimbledon House), Charles Nurse (Nurse's Hotel) and the brewer Eugene O'Keefe to form the Humber Steam Ferry Co. For several years, this company operated two ships to carry excursionists from Toronto to the owners' hotels at the Humber River.  To attract winter business Hicks and Duck constructed a racetrack on the river in winter 1888. Relations with Charles Nurse were sometimes strained.  In 1887, Hicks brought a civil action for trespass against Nurse. He claimed that Nurse had improperly fenced in part of public right of way south of the Lakeshore Road. Hicks' complaint was upheld on appeal. The hotel apparently suspended operation around 1889 before reopening several years later under a new owner.
As a boatbuilder, he is best known for canoes with a torpedo stem. He also built sailing canoes, skiffs and power boats. The boat factory was located on the north side of Lakeshore Road to the west of the Humber Beach Hotel. In 1907, the boat livery was moved to the east side of the river between the G.T.R. and the Lakeshore Road. The boathouse moved back to the west bank south of Lakeshore Road in 1913. This final boathouse was demolished in 1930 to accommodate a widening of Lakeshore Road.

In spring 1885, he constructed a 400 ft iron pier for the Ferry Company at High Park. The construction was unusual in that it was supported by 53 screw piles. Storm-driven ice destroyed the pier in March 1887.His contracting business built bridges and abutments. The firm also did more mundane work such as building a cinder path for bicyclists, earth moving, pile driving, and sand blasting. In 1904, his first commission was Musson's Bridge which carried the old Albion Road (now Flindon Road) over the Humber River. It was the first all-riveted steel bridge with a permanent floor. The eastern abutment of this bridge survives today. A bridge at Unionville was built in 1907 for Markham Township Council. Frank Barber claimed this was the first concrete beam bridge in York County. In 1909, he built the first concrete truss bridge in Canada. The exact type was a ""parabolic bowstring truss"". Two innovative techniques were used in construction of the bridge: ""the rods were given considerable tension before the concrete was poured by an ingenious device of the contractor""; ice bags were left overnight on the fresh concrete so that courses poured on successive days would bond properly. In 1909, he received a contract from Vaughan Municipal Council to build a reinforced concrete bridge over the Humber River between Purpleville and Kleinburg. This bridge was located near the intersection of Teston Rd and Kipling Avenue. The arch bridge over the Holland River at Newmarket was built by Hicks and designed by Frank Barber. This 1909 railway bridge has been stripped of its approach embankments and preserved as a historic structure.
He was also a pioneer in foundation work.  The engineer who designed the streetcar bridge over Mimico Creek considered the problem which beset the nearby Grand Trunk Railway bridge. The pilings of the abutment sank into the sand on the river bottom. Therefore, concrete abutments sitting on rock were specified. Hick's solution was to sink square concrete shells through twenty feet of sand. The shells sank as the inside sand was scooped out. The shells were then filled with concrete to yield bridge abutments. In 1906, he did the concrete work for the Toronto and York Radial Railway bridge over Etobicoke Creek. Hicks built the substructure of the Scarlett Road Bridge which was completed in November 1909.Some contractors considered him to be a bold and luck speculator (for instance, in his contract on the Mimico abutments mentioned above.) The writer, however, knows that he never gambled on a contract or took an avoidable risk. He had always considered well his modes of construction and he was one of the most accurate estimators the writer has known.","Octavius Laing Hicks (27 January 1852 – 23 December 1930) was a prominent citizen of Humber Bay in Etobicoke Township.

In 1911, he and his wife took a trip to the old country. The couple sailed their own cabin cruiser, Visitant, to Kingston and continued via steamer without any rail travel. 1913 is the last year in which Might's Directory Listed O L Hicks and Son as contractors.

","Walbeck is a village and a former municipality in the Börde district in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Since 1 January 2010, it is part of the town Oebisfelde-Weferlingen.


== Geography ==
Walbeck is situated in the west of the Magdeburg Börde on the Aller River at the northeastern rim of the Lappwald hill range. It is located about 4 km (2.5 mi) south of Weferlingen, near the border with Helmstedt in the state of Lower Saxony. A nearby crack of karstic (Muschelkalk) galleries is the site of a significant fossil deposit with numerous traces of Paleocene mammals (Arctocyonidae) and birds.
With effect from 1 January 2010, Walbeck and the neighbouring municipalities of Oebisfelde, Bösdorf, Eickendorf, Etingen, Kathendorf, Rätzlingen, Eschenrode, Döhren, Hödingen, Hörsingen, Schwanefeld, Seggerde, Siestedt, and Weferlingen merged to form the new town of Oebisfelde-Weferlingen.


== Walbeck Abbey ==

Walbeck was first mentioned in 929, when the local Saxon count Lothair I was killed in a battle against the Polabian Slavs near Lenzen. In 942 his son Count Lothair II of Walbeck dedicated a house monastery at his residence, part of a reparation after he had been involved in a failed assassination attempt instigated by the Ottonian duke Henry I of Bavaria against his brother King Otto I. Lothair reached his pardon; his son Count Lothair III of Walbeck and his descendants served as margrave of the Northern March from about 983.
The most notable member of the canon-convent was the medieval chronicler Thietmar of Merseburg, a relative of the Walbeck counts and provost from 1002. Thietmar consecrated the abbey church in 1015, a church bell from these times (the Walbeck Bell), one of the earliest extant in Germany, is today part of the collections of the Bode Museum in Berlin. After the Counts Walbeck had become extinct, their residence was slighted and the convent came under control of the Halberstadt cathedral chapter in 1229.
The monastery turned Protestant in 1591. The premises decayed and in 1810 Walbeck Abbey was finally abolished. Today the ruins of the Ottonian monastery church are a stop on the Romanesque Road.

Russia has an embassy in Khartoum and Sudan has an embassy in Moscow.


== History ==
For decades, Russia and Sudan have maintained a strong economic and politically strategic partnership. Due to solidarity with both the United States and with the Soviet Union and with the allies of the two nations, Sudan declared neutrality and instead chose membership in the Non-Aligned Movement throughout the Cold War. In 1967, in response to US support for Israel, Sudan severed relations with U.S.A. By 1970, 2000 advisors from Soviet Union and its satellites were present in Sudan. After the 1969 Sudanese coup d'état, the new government increased economic relations with the Soviet bloc, and in 1971, Soviet Union became the leading importer of Sudanese goods. Soviet-Sudanese relations were minorly damaged when, in 1971 members of the Sudanese Communist Party attempted to assassinate then-president Gaafar Nimeiry, and Nimeiry pegged the blame on the USSR, thus enhancing Sudanese relations with the West. In 1977, in response to large scale Soviet aid to Ethiopia, Sudan expelled Soviet advisors and closed the military section in the Soviet embassy. The relations were damaged again when Sudan supported the Mujahadeen in Afghanistan when the USSR invaded in 1979. Sudan began to buy weapons from Egypt and China, instead of USSR. In 1985, Nimeiry was overthrown in a military coup, and the new government improved relations with USSR. Diplomatic cooperation between the two countries dramatically got back on track during the late 1990s and early 2000s, when Vladimir Putin was elected the President, and then the Prime Minister of Russia, and along with Chinese leader Hu Jintao opposed UN Peacekeepers in Darfur. Russia strongly supports Sudan's territorial integrity and opposes the creation of an independent Darfurian state. Also, Russia is Sudan's strongest investment partner (in Europe) and political ally in Europe, and Russia has repeatedly and significantly regarded Sudan as an important global ally in the African continent. For decades there have been Sudanese college students studying in Russian universities.During the 2008 attack on Omdurman and Khartoum, Justice and Equality Movement rebels from Darfur killed a Russian mercenary pilot by shooting his plane down when he tried to strafe them.

Amnesty International slammed Russia for breaking the UN arms embargo on Darfur, Russians sold weapons like Mi-24 helicopters, Antonov 26 planes, Russian weapons sales to Sudan totaled 21 million dollars. It was reported these weapons were used to slaughter Darfur civilians. The report said Russia ""cannot have been unaware of reports of serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law by the Sudanese security forces, But they have nevertheless continued to allow military equipment to be sent to Sudan."" Russia was reported to ""have been or should have been aware, several types of military equipment, including aircraft, have been deployed by the Sudanese armed forces for direct attacks on civilians and indiscriminate attacks in Darfur"". The Janjaweed also used Russian small arms to murder and loot, these Russian weapons spread into neighboring Chad. In 2005 helicopters from Russia were sold to Sudan for 7 million pounds sterling. Photos show Russian helicopters in Darfur.On August 25, 2017, the Russian ambassador to Sudan, Mirgayas Shirinsky, was found dead in his house in Khartoum.In November 2017, President Omar al-Bashir credited Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War for saving Syria. Sudan is among the few countries that officially recognized the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation and voted against United Nations General Assembly Resolution 68/262 (which condemned Russian annexation of Ukrainian territory), which demonstrated the close relations between Russia and Sudan.


== Military ==
SIPRI reports that only 8 percent of Sudanese arms are Chinese, and that Russian arms actually make up the majority, at 87 percent. Russia is the major weapons supplier to the Sudan.In 2019, Sudan and Russia signed an agreement, which reportedly gives Russian Navy access to Sudanese ports. In November 2020, Vladimir Putin announced that the Russian Navy would proceed with building a base capable of hosting 300 personnel and four warships on Sudan's Red Sea coast. In December 2020, the agreement to build the base was signed, which would give Russia a naval base in Port Sudan for at least 25 years. This was compared to Russia's naval base in Tartus, Syria. However in June 2021, the Associated Press reported that the agreement was not ratified by Sudan's parliament and the Sudanese military indicated it would review the agreement. Sudan’s Chief of General Staff, Gen. Mohammed Othman al-Hussein stated, “We are negotiating a possible review to this deal, to ensure that our interests and our profits are taken into account.”

== Premise ==
Harry Exton, an ex-soldier, is a ""Button Man"", a hired killer pitted against others in an underground sport. Each works for a mysterious ""Voice"", a rich man of unknown identity. The object of the game is to defeat one's opponents, and take their marker – the first two joints of a finger. Button Men who lose three fingers are executed. While killing an opponent is generally acceptable, it is not always the preferred outcome of a match - on one occasion Exton's Voice loses a wager when Exton kills his opponent rather than taking his marker, thus beginning the souring of the relationship between Exton and his Voice.  The Voices profit from the game by gambling on the outcome, and a ruthless killer such as Harry Exton can make a modestly wealthy man extremely rich.  The Button Men themselves are paid well for their tasks.
Despite being exceptionally good at the sport and not losing any markers during his involvement, Exton decides to quit, and tracks down his Voice killing him, thinking that will remove him from the sport.  This grants him temporary freedom and he settles down anonymously in a small town, even starting an affair with a local waitress.  He is himself tracked down by other Button Men (and a Button Woman) whose Voices view Exton as the ultimate sport due to his previous unparalleled success.  Exton has advance warning of their presence when he spots them disguised as tourists in the Diner his girlfriend works at, and notices that one is missing two markers. Exton kills all the other operatives apart from one with whom he makes a deal - he cuts off his own finger and gives it to the surviving Button Man before dropping a tracking device (inserted into a filling by the jealous husband) into a lake.  This convinces the Voices that Exton is dead, and the hunt is called off.  Later Exton reneges on his deal and kills the final Button Man to ensure that there are no loose ends.

In an interview with the Class of '79 fanzine, John Wagner said the original movie option rights were negotiated by the book's original US publisher, Kitchen Sink.For some years, the film rights were owned by DreamWorks, which co-opted the producers of Wagner's A History of Violence. The film was initially rumoured to be planned for release in 2008. In late May 2012, Deadline Hollywood reported that Nicolas Winding Refn was in talks with DreamWorks about directing.

Fourth National Climate Assessment,"['Articles containing video clips', 'Climate change assessment and attribution', 'Climate change in the United States', 'Reports of the United States government']","Fourth National Climate Assessment (NCA4) 2017/2018 is a 1,500 page two-part congressionally mandated report by the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP)—the first of its kind by the Trump administration, who released the report on November 23, 2018. The climate assessment process, with a report to be submitted to Congress every four years, is mandated by law through the Global Change Research Act of 1990. The report, which took two years to complete, is the fourth in a series of National Climate Assessments (NCA) which included NCA1 (2000), NCA2 (2009), and NCA3 (2014).Volume 1 of NCA4, ""Climate Science Special Report"" (CSSR) was released in October 2017. In the CSSR, researchers reported that ""it is extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. For the warming over the last century, there is no convincing alternative explanation supported by the extent of the observational evidence."": 22 Volume 2, entitled ""Impacts, Risks, and Adaptation in the United States"", was released on November 23, 2018. According to NOAA, ""human health and safety"" and American ""quality of life"" is ""increasingly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change"". Like the previous reports in this series, the NCA4 is a ""stand-alone report of the state of science relating to climate change and its physical impacts"".
The authors say that without more significant mitigation efforts, there will be ""substantial damages on the U.S. economy, human health, and the environment. Under scenarios with high emissions and limited or no adaptation, annual losses in some sectors are estimated to grow to hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century.""While the CSSR is ""designed to be an authoritative assessment of the science of climate change"" in the United States, it does not include policy recommendations.

== Background ==
President George H.W. Bush signed the Global Change Research Act of 1990 104 Stat. 3096 into law on November 16, 1990, which established the United States Global Change Research Program with a mandate to understand and respond to global change, including the cumulative effects of human activities and natural processes on the environment, to promote discussions toward international protocols in global change research, and for other purposes.""Although the National Climate Assessment was mandated to release a report every four years, there have only been four reports since Global Change Research Act of 1990 was enacted.


== NCA4 Authors ==
In the preparation of the NCA4, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), one of thirteen federal agencies comprising the USGCRP team, was the ""administrative lead agency."" The other agencies included the DOA, DOC, DOD, DOE, HHS, DOI, DOS, DOT, EPA, NASA, NSF, Smithsonian Institution, and the USAID. The report was produced with the assistance of ""1,000 people, including 300 leading scientists, roughly half from outside the government."" The Federal Science Steering Committee (SSC) for the CSSR included representatives from NOAA, NASA, and DOE, USGCRP and 3 Coordinating Lead Authors.


== Process ==
The Obama administration released a review draft of the CCSR with a public review period running from December 15, 2016 through February 3, 2017.


== Public policy ==

While the CSSR is ""designed to be an authoritative assessment of the science of climate change"" in the United States, it does not include policy recommendations. On August 20, 2017, the Trump administration notified the 15-person Federal Advisory Committee for the Sustained National Climate Assessment that he was dissolving the Federal Advisory Committee. The Federal Advisory Panel translating the NCA's scientific studies and findings into actionable public policy that individual states could implement to reduce emissions. According to an August 20, 2017 article in the Washington Post, the role of the Federal Advisory Panel for the National Climate Assessment was to assist ""policymakers and private-sector officials incorporate the government’s climate analysis into long-term planning"". The panel was tasked with translating dozens of studies and scientific revelations that constitute the National Climate Assessment into policy actions that states could use to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In January 2018 Andrew Cuomo, Governor of the State of New York, part of a coalition of States, reconvened a modified and limited version of the science advisory panel chaired by Columbia University's Earth Institute's Richard Moss. The States' panel cannot ""replace federal support for science, including maintaining satellites and building better climate models"" nor will it have any ""sway over federal climate policy"".


== Key findings ==
An article in The Atlantic said that the report ""warns, repeatedly and directly, that climate change could soon imperil the American way of life, transforming every region of the country, imposing frustrating costs on the economy, and harming the health of virtually every citizen.""In the section on mitigation, the report says that without more significant mitigation efforts, there will be ""substantial damages on the U.S. economy, human health, and the environment. Under scenarios with high emissions and limited or no adaptation, annual losses in some sectors are estimated to grow to hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century."" The report cited a 2017 study, published in the journal Science, that estimated the economic damage to the U.S. economy in relation to increases in the global mean surface temperature (GMST).The report said that across the United States damages are ""intensifying"". The report which analyzed the ""effects of climate change by U.S. region"", emphasize[d] that ""poor and marginalized communities"" with be the most negatively ""impacted by the intensifying storms and weather patterns caused by global warming.""
""While Americans are responding in ways that can bolster resilience and improve livelihoods, neither global efforts to mitigate the causes of climate change nor regional efforts to adapt to the impacts currently approach the scales needed to avoid substantial damages to the U.S. economy, environment, and human health and well-being over the coming decades.""


=== Volume 1 ===
A 2018 CRS cited the October 2017 ""Climate Science Special Report"" CSSR: ""Detection and attribution studies, climate models, observations, paleoclimate data, and physical understanding lead to high confidence (extremely likely) that more than half of the observed global mean warming since 1951 was caused by humans, and high confidence that internal climate variability played only a minor role (and possibly even a negative contribution) in the observed warming since 1951. The key message and supporting text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the peer-reviewed detection and attribution literature, including in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report."": 127 : 2 


=== Volume 2 ===
According to Volume II, ""Impacts, Risks, and Adaptation in the United States"", ""Without substantial and sustained global mitigation and regional adaptation efforts, climate change is expected to cause growing losses to American infrastructure and property and impede the rate of economic growth over this century."" The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was ""administrative lead agency"" in the preparation of the Fourth National Climate Assessment.


==== Chapters (Volume 2) ====
Volume 2 of NCA4 has fifteen chapters: Chapter 1: Our Globally Changing Climate Chapter 2: ""Physical Drivers of Climate Change"", Chapter 3: ""Detection and Attribution of Climate Change"", Chapter 4: ""Climate Models, Scenarios, and Projections"", Chapter 5: ""Large-Scale Circulation and Climate Variability"", Chapter 6: ""Temperature Changes in the United States"", Chapter 7: ""Precipitation Change in the United States"", Chapter 8: ""Droughts, Floods, and Wildfire"", Chapter 9: ""Extreme Storms"", Chapter 10: ""Changes in Land Cover and Terrestrial Biogeochemistry"", Chapter 11: ""Arctic Changes and their Effects on Alaska and the Rest of the United States"", Chapter 12: ""Sea Level Rise"", Chapter 13: ""Ocean Acidification and Other Ocean Changes"", Chapter 14: ""Perspectives on Climate Change Mitigation"", and Chapter 15: ""Potential Surprises: Compound Extremes and Tipping Elements"".Chapter one provided an overview. ""Risks are often highest for those that are already vulnerable, including low-income communities, some communities of color, children, and the elderly...Climate change threatens to exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities that result in higher exposure and sensitivity to extreme weather and climate-related events and other changes.""Chapter 2, entitled ""Our Changing Climate: Observations, Causes, and Future Change"", reported on observed changes in the United States, such as ""intensifying"" and more frequent atmospheric rivers of rain that connect Asia with the United States, ""[h]igh temperature extremes"", increasing ""heavy precipitation events"", retreating glaciers and shrinking snow cover, the decline of sea ice, warming, sea level rising and increasing ocean acidification, more frequent flooding along the coastlines, lengthening growing seasons, and increasing wildfires.


== Reactions ==

In a November 26 scrum with reporters in Washington, DC, President Trump told reporters he had seen and read some of the report but he doesn't believe it. The White House dismissed the NCA4 as ""inaccurate"". White House spokesperson, Lindsay Walters  said that the climate report was ""largely based on the most extreme scenario"". Walters called for future NCA reports to have a ""more transparent and data-driven process that includes fuller information on the range of potential scenarios and outcomes"". Katharine Hayhoe, an atmospheric scientist from Texas Tech University said that Walters' claim was ""demonstrably false"". Hayhoe confirmed that the report ""considers all scenarios, from those where we go carbon negative before end of century to those where carbon emissions continue to rise"".The New York Times reported ""White House officials made a calculation that Mr. Trump’s core base of supporters most likely would not care that its findings are so at odds with the president’s statements and policies.” Steven Milloy, a climate-change denier who served on Trump's EPA transition team, called the report a product of the deep state, adding ""We don’t care. In our view, this is made-up hysteria anyway."" He noted that the Administration did not alter the report's findings but rather chose to release it the day after Thanksgiving ""on a day when nobody cares, and hope it gets swept away by the next day’s news.""An article in The Atlantic called the report ""massive"", a ""grave climate warning"", and a ""huge achievement for American science"".Both the Washington Post and Vox described the report as ""major"". The Post described it as the Trump administration's climate report. Vox news described it as ""dire"".A November 23, 2018 Reuters article published in The New York Times cited the NCA4: ""With continued growth in emissions at historic rates, annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century - more than the current gross domestic product (GDP) of many U.S. states."" In July 2019 the Times cited the NCA4 in its own reporting to underscore the threat of sea level rise to the trillion-dollar coastal real estate market.Articles in Reuters/The New York Times, and the BBC,  said that the warning issued by the 4th NCA ""is at odds with the Trump administration's fossil fuels agenda.""An article in The Hill described the report as ""damning"", 'sounding the alarm' on the impact of climate change and contrasted the findings of NCA4 with doubts about climate change science expressed by President Trump.An article in The Verge called it a ""bleak black Friday report.""An article in the Los Angeles Times said that the release of NCA4 was important in ""tackling a misconception by many Americans that the changing climate doesn’t harm them personally."" The report shows ""how climate change is already affecting each one of us, whether we live in Texas or Minnesota or Hawai’i or Florida.""Collin O’Mara, President of the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) issued a statement in which he called the timing of the Black Friday release by the White House of the NCA4 report—a month before its anticipated release—a ""disgrace"". O’Mara said that, ""It’s an absolute disgrace to bury the truth about climate impacts in a year that saw hundreds of Americans die during devastating climate-fueled megafires, hurricanes, floods, and algal blooms.""In a November 23, 2018 press release, the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) described how the 1,500-page report was based on ""the best available science"" and serves to assist the U.S. in ""understand[ing], assess[ing], predict[ing] and respond[ing] to"" climate change. It ""examines the climate and economic impacts U.S. residents could expect if drastic action is not taken to address climate change"".In May 2019, The New York Times reported that the Trump administration was planning to make changes in the climate modeling methods used to create the next report which is due in 2022.   Rather than project impacts of change to the end of the century as has been done in the past, they will project only to 2040. The administration is also planning to create a climate change review panel that would question the conclusions of the 2022 report.  The Times reported that William Happer,   who ""would be a fringe figure even for climate skeptics"", would head the panel.

== History ==
Within the parish is Nottingham Hill Camp a promentary hill fort which was occupied during the Iron Age, Romano-British and possibly Anglo-Saxon periods. It has been scheduled as an ancient monument.The estate was the property of Tewkesbury Abbey until the dissolution of the monasteries. It was then sold and became part of the Stanway estate. There is some archaeological evidence that there may once have been a settlement around the chapel.Pardon Hill Farm is a 17th-century timber-framed farmhouse.  It has a 19th-century ice house, and 18th century workshop.Prescott House was enlarged by Edward Law, 1st Earl of Ellenborough around 1860 in Tudor Gothic style. Nearby are two stone monoliths each 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) high.


== Events ==
The Prescott Speed Hill Climb takes place here. The site was purchased in 1937 by the Bugatti Owners' Club and the site includes the Bugatti Trust Museum. The races are organised by the Vintage Sports-Car Club.


== Religious sites ==
There is a 12th-century chapel of ease which is a Grade II* listed building. It may have been dependent on the church at Winchcombe.

His nickname is ""Tuti"". He is best known for his stage roles as Shuichiro Oishi of the Prince of Tennis musical series, Tenimyu, and as Gin Ichimaru in the rock musical Bleach.","Yuichi Tsuchiya (土屋 裕一, Tsuchiya Yūichi, born February 6, 1979 in Minami-Alps, Yamanashi) is a Japanese actor and full-time member of the 4-man theatre troupe  *pnish*. His nickname is ""Tuti"". He is best known for his stage roles as Shuichiro Oishi of the Prince of Tennis musical series, Tenimyu, and as Gin Ichimaru in the rock musical Bleach.


== Early life ==
Yuichi Tsuchiya grew up in the Akaishi Mountains region of Yamanashi Prefecture.  He has a younger sister, and his mother Yumiko runs a beauty parlor. He is a graduate of Yamanashi Prefectural Koufu First High School.


== Early career ==
Tsuchiya's career as an actor is primarily that of a stage actor with occasional movie parts. His first few performances were in 1997 with a traveling theatre troupe, ""Gekidan Geiyuuza"". After one year with them he signed on with the theatre troupe BQMAP in 1998. He first appeared in one of their shows in July 1998, a production called Re-. He continued to perform with them until late 2000.
In early 2000 (concurrent with his involvement with BQMAP), Tsuchiya began to perform with a group called ""ShiroxKuro"". In June 2000 they put on their first performance, Best Team, following up in February 2001  with Set a Trap.
On July 1, 2001, ShiroxKuro renamed themselves  *pnish*. The group has been involved in ten stage performances, their own radio program (which ended in June 2008) and their own weekly television show (Hottokenai! *pnish* TV). Tsuchiya was a member of the original nine-member troupe, which now consists of four performers.


== Tenimyu ==
Tsuchiya's major stage appearance came in 2003 when he originated the role of Shuichiro Oishi, the motherly vice-captain of Seigaku Middle School's tennis club, as part of the first generation Seigaku cast in Tenimyu, the Prince of Tennis musical series. He played the role from 2003 to 2005, and his character served as the emcee of the first Dream Live live concert. During his run on the series, he worked with fellow  *pnish* actor Eiji Moriyama (who played Takeshi Momoshiro). Tsuchiya graduated from his role after the Side Fudomine musical; along with several other graduated Tenimyu actors, Tsuchiya got a cameo in the Prince of Tennis live film adaptation.
Since Tsuchiya left the Prince of Tennis the role of Oishi has been played by Hiroki Suzuki, Yukihiro Takiguchi, Yuya Toyoda, Yuki Tsujimoto, and is currently played by Jin Hiramaki.
Tsuchiya returned to his role as Oishi and reunite with the 1st generation Seigaku cast to perform in Tenimyu's Dream Live 7th to celebrate the end of Tenimyu's first season.


== Other roles ==
Tsuchiya stars as Gin Ichimaru in the rock musical Bleach, which has also featured some of his old Tenimyu castmates.
Tsuchiya played a double role in the Hunter x Hunter musical Hunter x Hunter: Nightmare of Zaoldyeck in 2002, where he worked with Prince of Tennis voice actors Kaida Yuki and Hiroki Takahashi. He portrayed Zebro the gatekeeper, as well as a butler.

She was awarded multiple literature prizes. She is known for being a prominent young poet of the new generation and the most awarded young author in recent Croatian history, sometimes called a ""literary sensation"".

She was awarded multiple literature prizes. She is known for being a prominent young poet of the new generation and the most awarded young author in recent Croatian history, sometimes called a ""literary sensation"". She explores the topics of poverty, domestic violence, immigration, and class and gender inequalities.


== Biography ==
She grew up in small village Pecki, near Petrinja, where she studied Physics, first at University of Zagreb and then at the University of Rijeka. She currently lives, works as an editor and raises two kids in Zagreb.
“No one among our contemporary authors laughs like Monika Herceg; nor writes more sorrowful poems,” writes Miljenko Jergović, a Croatian novelist and essayist. The latter statement is especially true when it comes to Herceg’s debut poetry collection Initial Coordinates. The poems in the book portray the lives of women in rural Croatia throughout the twentieth century, whose stories of poverty and struggle are recounted in the voices of Herceg’s family members.
“There were no books in our house, and paper was only used to light the fire,” Monika recalls. However, during her education in the Croatian town of Petrinja, her teachers soon recognized her talent and provided her the support her family could not. Herceg began writing poetry while working several jobs, all taken on to finance her study of physics.


== Work and career ==
In 2017, she won Goran for her book Početne koordinate(Initial Coordinates), the most important award for young authors in Croatia. As a result, the book was published in 2018 and, after that, she won the Kvirin Award, Fran Galović Slavić award and the international award Mostovi Struge.   
Initial Coordinates details Herceg’s return to the roots of her family and to those earliest, often traumatic, memories that have haunted her throughout her life.   
Her second book, Lovostaj (The Closed Season) (Jesenski i Turk, 2019.), was also a success: the manuscript won the Na vrh jezika award for the best unpublished poetry volume in 2018 and was published in 2019. Her third book, Vrijeme prije jezika (Time Before the Tongue) (Fraktura, 2020 ) won the Zvonko Milković award.   
At the international level, she won the second prize of the International Poetry Competition Castello di Duino that took place in Italy in 2016 and in 2018, she was granted the Bridges of Struga award during the Mostovi Struge festival in Macedonia  for best debut of a young author. In 2021 she won the Fierce Women award for her activism.Her works have been translated in more than fifteen languages and they were published by some well-known magazines. She is part of Versopolis, an online platform dedicated to the promotion of young European authors. Her trilingual poetry books have been published in Lithuania and Austria. Another selection of her works have been published in French as Ciel sous tension, L’Ollave, 2019.Her stories were also awarded with several regional and national awards, such as the Biber  award and the Lapis Histriae award.
Her drama script Gdje se kupuju nježnosti (Where to Buy Tenderness) was awarded by the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb. Her play took off in 2021 and was a success. She was awarded for other drama scripts and also was granted the Marin Držić award the most, important drama script award in Croatia, for her drama Kill Yourself, Dear Dad,.
She is a member of the Croatia Writers Society and of the editorial board of their magazine.

== Composition ==
It was initially constituted with four members, Chile, Peru, Zaire and Zambia. A further four were added to the cartel in 1975 - Australia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Yugoslavia.
CIPEC represented around 30% of the world's refined copper, and more than 50% of the proven reserves of copper. The intent of the members to secure higher prices failed, particularly of increasing the price during the crisis of 1975-1976, and the subsequent change of behavior of Chile finally finished the cartel.
Many experts consider that the market power of this cartel was negligible, because the residual demand that it faced was elastic (much higher than OPEC, for example). The inability of coordinating output cutbacks during the extensive period of life of CIPEC seems to validate this hypothesis. It was dissolved during the 1990s.


== CIPEC stages ==
There were three stages of the CIPEC that economists recognize:

Nationalization stage (1967–1973)
Unilateral Action stage (1973–1976)
Reflux stage (1976–1988)


== Environmental conditions for CIPEC ==
The OPEC embargo marked a turning point in the history of the international copper trade, waking up the countries that depended strongly on their exports of commodities. They desired to imitate the behavior of CIPEC with the objective of increasing the prices of their commodities.
Motivated by Rio Tinto Zinc (RTZ), in November 1974 in Lusaka the members of CIPEC reached an agreement to reduce copper exports by 10% -- later increased to 15% -- until the first half of 1976. The high incentives meant that the countries did not fully complete the agreement and in fact in this period only 300,000 tons of copper were reduced by the cartel — hardly half of the reductions contemplated in the agreement. High inventories and the growth of sources outside of the cartel prevented the policies adopted by CIPEC from giving benefit to its members.

Sergeant Rees, leading his platoon, gradually worked his way round the right flank, by making short rushes, to the rear of the gun position. At 20 yards from the machine gun, Sergeant Rees rushed forward towards it, shooting one of the crew, and bayoneting the other. He bombed a large concrete emplacement, killing five of the enemy and taking 30 prisoners, including two officers and capturing a machine gun, undamaged.

This cardiomyopathy is one of the leading causes of sudden cardiac death. The adjective ischemic means characteristic of, or accompanied by, ischemia — local anemia due to mechanical obstruction of the blood supply.

","Ischemic cardiomyopathy is a type of cardiomyopathy caused by a narrowing of the coronary arteries which supply blood to the heart. Typically, patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy have a history of acute myocardial infarction, however, it may occur in patients with coronary artery disease, but without a past history of acute myocardial infarction. This cardiomyopathy is one of the leading causes of sudden cardiac death. The adjective ischemic means characteristic of, or accompanied by, ischemia — local anemia due to mechanical obstruction of the blood supply.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Signs and symptoms of ischemic cardiomyopathy include sudden fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness, and palpitations.


== Cause ==
Ischemic cardiomyopathy is the cause of more than 60% of all cases of systolic congestive heart failure in most countries of the world. A chest radiograph that demonstrates coronary artery calcification is a probable indication of ischemic cardiomyopathy.The following are causes of ischemic cardiomyopathy:
Diabetes
Atherosclerosis
Vasospasm
Inflammation of arteries


== Pathophysiology ==
Ischemic cardiomyopathy is caused by too little blood flow and hence oxygen reaching the muscular layer of the heart due to a narrowing of coronary arteries in turn causing cell death. This can cause different levels of tissue injury and affect large and intermediate arteries alike.


== Diagnosis ==
Ischemic cardiomyopathy can be diagnosed via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol, imaging both global and regional function. Also the Look-Locker technique is used to identify diffuse fibrosis; it is therefore important to be able to determine the extent of the ischemic scar. Some argue that only left main- or proximal-left anterior descending artery disease is relevant to the diagnostic criteria for ischemic cardiomyopathy. Myocardial imaging usually demonstrates left ventricular dilation, severe ventricular dysfunction, and multiple infarctions. Signs include congestive heart failure, angina edema, weight gain and fainting, among others.


== Management ==

Restoring adequate blood flow to the heart muscle in people with heart failure and significant coronary artery disease is strongly associated with improved survival, some research showing up to 75% survival rates over 5 years. A stem cell study indicated that using autologous cardiac stem cells as a regenerative approach for the human heart (after a heart attack) has great potential.American Heart Association practice guidelines recommend implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)  use in those with ischemic cardiomyopathy (40 days post-MI) that are (NYHA) New York Heart Association functional class I. A LVEF measurement (simply called LVEF alone among cardiologists) of greater than (>) 30% is often used to differentiate primary from ischemic cardiomyopathy, and as a prognostic indicator.A 2004 study showed the patients in that study who underwent ventricular restoration as well as a coronary artery bypass achieved greater postoperative LVEF than with the latter surgery alone. Severe cases are treated with heart transplantation.


== Prognosis ==
One of the most important features differentiating ischemic cardiomyopathy from the other forms of cardiomyopathy is the shortened, or worsened all-cause mortality in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. According to several studies, coronary artery bypass graft surgery has a survival advantage over medical therapy (for ischemic cardiomyopathy) across varied follow-ups.

== Overview ==
According to the Italian Constitution, the Mayor of Foggia is member of the City Council.
The Mayor is elected by the population of Foggia, who also elect the members of the City Council, controlling the Mayor's policy guidelines and is able to enforce his resignation by a motion of no confidence. The Mayor is entitled to appoint and release the members of his government.
Since 1995 the Mayor is elected directly by Foggia's electorate: in all mayoral elections in Italy in cities with a population higher than 15,000 the voters express a direct choice for the mayor or an indirect choice voting for the party of the candidate's coalition. If no candidate receives at least 50% of votes, the top two candidates go to a second round after two weeks. The election of the City Council is based on a direct choice for the candidate with a preference vote: the candidate with the majority of the preferences is elected. The number of the seats for each party is determined proportionally.

== Education ==
Thalhammer was born in Florissant, Missouri. She first studied art at St. Joseph's Academy while working as a waitress at her family's truck stop. She attended the Chicago Institute of Art at the age of 16, for an art program that focused on figure drawing and realized she wanted to pursue art professionally. She received, with honors, her Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in painting with a double minor in Women's Studies and Art History from the University of Kansas and studied abroad at Staffordshire University in England. She moved to Washington D.C. in 2004.


== Career ==
Thalhammer's work has been covered by publications including U.S. News & World Report, the Washington Post, and the Washington Blade. The Blade featured her on its cover in 2008 and nominated her for ""best visual artist"" in 2013.Thalhammer has been influenced and inspired by Artemisia Gentileschi.Thalhammer has exhibited her works at several galleries in Washington D.C. such as the Transformer Gallery and G-Fine Arts Gallery. In 2013 she had a solo show called Intimate Network at The Fridge Gallery in Washington, which included 13 pieces of portraiture and abstract work. In 2010, she collaborated with another Washington artist, Sheila Criter, to create a window mural at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center called Butterfly Speeches.


== Art and activism ==
Lisa Marie Thalhammer uses her artworks as part of political actions to communicate positive messages of equality, persistence, empowerment and love.


=== LOVE ===
Thalhammer's LOVE design made its debut in the 2016 Capital Pride Parade as float banners. In January 2017 Thalhammer created posters with her LOVE artwork, advocating for an end to hate while protesting the United States presidential inauguration. She has since carried her LOVE poster art in many political protests in Washington D.C. including the People's Climate March, the Native Nations March, the March For Our Lives and the Capital Pride 2017 & 2018 Parades.In January 2018, Thalhammer's original 10 foot wide LOVE painting on paper was exhibited at Into Action, a social justice art festival in Downtown LA.


=== Strong Woman ===
As part of an organized effort of multiple artists from Washington and Los Angeles, Thalhammer used her artwork to participate in the 2017 inaugural Women's March on Washington. A racially diverse team of women carried Thalhammer's 24 foot diameter painting titled “Strong Woman: LOVE for All” which features a multiracial women flexing her arms wearing camouflaged pants in front of a rainbow colored background.  The artwork was later displayed at the 2018 United State of Women Summit in Los Angeles, CA.


== Notable murals ==


=== Boxer Girl ===
""Boxer Girl"", Thalhammer's first public mural, was installed over Memorial Day weekend in 2009 and is located at 1st and W Streets NW in Washington. It was inspired by the women in Thalhammer's life and her observations of women's interactions with male peers in her community, and also by her athletic experiences and appreciation for team sports.
The mural sparked some controversy as members of the neighborhood had mixed reactions to it. In a neighborhood committee meeting, a police officer reported that after installation of the mural, crime in that area had decreased by 55 percent.The DC Commission of Arts and Humanities awarded Thalhammer a grant to create Boxer Girl. Thalhammer decided to paint Boxer Girl in her own neighborhood, Bloomingdale, on the side of the home of a long-time supporter and friend, Veronica Jackson.


=== LOVE mural ===
Thalhammer painted her ""LOVE"" mural in the Blagden Alley Shaw neighborhood of Washington D.C. in August 2017 on four steel gates. It has since become popular among Instagram users and photographers. The mural has appeared in Washingtonian Magazine, a Destination DC Date Night commercial, and the Netflix series ""Stay Here.


=== Mural controversy ===
In 2016 Thalhammer collaborated with fellow artist Aja Adams on the design of a mural which Thalhammer completed in summer 2017; it is located in the alley next to 57 O Street NW in Washington, D.C. The project received a $50,000 grant from the DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities. Adams was not paid the amount she expected for her contributions. In response to her complaint, the commission initially threatened to pull the grant, but later stated that it was simply a contractual disagreement.

He fought at the Battle of Brandywine and at the Battle of Germantown and wintered at Valley Forge.


== Early life ==
Israel Shreve was born December 24, 1739, in the Shreve family homestead at Mount Pleasant, in Mansfield Township, Burlington County, New Jersey, an old community founded by Quakers. His father was Benjamin Shreve and his mother was Rebecca French; they were married at Springfield Township Friends Meeting House February 23, 1729, and raised eight children, of whom Israel was fifth. Israel married Grace Curtis February 27, 1760, at a Quaker meeting somewhere in Burlington County, New Jersey, and after she died in 1771 Israel married Mary Cokely on May 10, 1773, in Philadelphia. Grace gave birth to four children, while Mary gave birth to seven more. One of these was Henry Miller Shreve. Israel worked and owned farm land and was appointed justice of the peace for Gloucester County, New Jersey, in February, 1775.


== Revolutionary War ==
After news came of the Battles of Lexington and Concord, Israel and his brothers William and Samuel enlisted as officers in the New Jersey State militia. In October 1775, the Continental Congress recommended to the Provincial Congress of New Jersey that two battalions of soldiers be raised for service in the Continental Army. Israel was appointed lieutenant colonel in the second battalion, under command of Colonel William Maxwell. Also serving in this battalion was Israel's thirteen-year-old son, John.The 2nd New Jersey Regiment was sent north to relieve Benedict Arnold's attack on Quebec. The regiment arrived in Albany, New York by March 27, 1776, then reached Fort Ticonderoga by April 18. Shreve arrived in Quebec City May 3 under cannon fire from the British. When a British fleet appeared in the Saint Lawrence River, Shreve retreated west with 1,900 Americans. General John Thomas ordered Shreve to take some of the wounded to Sorel, at the juncture of the Richelieu and Saint Lawrence River. By June 11, American forces had been defeated by British troops near Trois-Rivières, Quebec, and they abandoned Sorel on June 14, just three hours before the British arrived. Shreve was back at Fort Ticonderoga June 16, 1776, and remained there until November, when the enlistments for the 2nd New Jersey expired.By April 1777, Shreve and his regiment were in Princeton, New Jersey. He spent the summer in Reading, Pennsylvania, and returned to service in November 1777. From March to May 1778, Shreve and the 2nd New Jersey were stationed at Haddonfield, New Jersey. When General Charles Cornwallis led British troops out of Philadelphia, some of his men burned Shreve's house near Mount Holly, and Sir Henry Clinton offered a reward of 25 guineas for information on the soldiers' identities. Shreve's 2nd New Jersey followed the British to Monmouth Courthouse, site of the Battle of Monmouth on June 28, 1778. Shreve walked over the battlefield after the British had retreated farther north to New York.The following year Shreve took the 2nd New Jersey on the Sullivan Expedition. They left Easton, Pennsylvania, on June 18, 1779, arriving in Wyoming, Pennsylvania, five days later. They remained in Wyoming more than a month before loading 117 rowboats with 1,200 pack horses and 900 cattle. The regiment reached Wyalusing, Pennsylvania, on August 5 and Tioga Point on August 11. The next day General John Sullivan ordered his combined forces to Chemung, Pennsylvania, ten miles (16 km) west of Tioga Point, where they burned an Indian village and Israel's son, John, witnessed a skirmish with a retreating native tribe; a man standing next to him was killed by musket fire. Both Israel and John Shreve returned to an army fort at Tioga while Sullivan led his command farther west.In November 1779, Shreve led the 2nd New Jersey Regiment to the Continental Army's winter encampment at Morristown, New Jersey. On June 7, 1780, the British Army under Henry Clinton crossed from Staten Island to New Jersey. On June 23, they came west from Elizabeth, New Jersey, toward Chatham and Morristown, and met Americans at Springfield Township. The ensuing fight became known as the Battle of Springfield. Shreve's men waited at a bridge just west of the village of Springfield as Hessians under Lieutenant General Wilhelm, Baron von Knyphausen came from the east. As Shreve's men fired cannons, a musket ball crashed into a soldier standing next to John Shreve, and as he turned his companion over another musket ball hit John's calf. Israel Shreve's regiment was in danger of being surrounded, so General Nathanael Greene ordered him to retreat.On January 20, 1781, Shreve alerted Washington about revolt in the New Jersey Line of the Continental Army at Pompton, New Jersey, ""It is with pain I inform your Excellency, that the troops at this place revolted this evening and marched towards Trenton. Their behaviour and demands are similar to those of the Pennsylvania line."" Washington answered the same day requesting to suppress the Pompton Mutiny, which was accomplished by General Robert Howe.Shreve resigned his commission in the Continental Army in January 1781. Two years later, he joined other New Jersey officers in becoming a founding member of the Society of the Cincinnati in the State of New Jersey.


== Later life ==
In 1788 he led his wife and six of his children, along with twenty one other settlers to south-western Pennsylvania, and settled in Rostraver Township, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania. In January 1789 - June 1789, Shreve accompanied retired Continental Army colonel George Morgan to Spanish Louisiana Territory to survey the western bank of the Mississippi River. Morgan, who was a land developer, received permission from the Spanish Ambassador to the United States, Don Diego de Gardoqui to establish a colony on the Mississippi River at Anse a la Graisse, located in present-day Missouri. On January 3, 1789, the expedition departed from Pittsburgh and traveled along the Ohio and Mississippi River until they reached Anse a la Graisse; a new town was demarcated and named New Madrid by Morgan. On June 19, 1789, members of the expedition including Shreve safely returned to Pittsburgh. During the journey, Shreve kept a journal, in which he described geography, environment, and encounters with the Native Americans.Instead of moving to New Madrid, Shreve decided to lease land in Fayette County, Pennsylvania, from General George Washington. Shreve contracted to buy 1,744 acres (7.06 km2) of land from Washington, but spent several years haggling over payments and prices despite settling on the land. Washington threatened to bring a lawsuit for payment, but no suit was recorded. Washington wrote Shreve in 1798 and 1799 asking for payments due, but could not bring himself to sue a fellow army officer. In his turn, on 21 December 1798, Shreve wrote to Washington asking for delay in payments. Shreve and Washington both died on the same day - December 14, 1799 - although hundreds of miles apart.

She was known for her children's poetry and published verse novel for children.


== Life ==
O'Keeffe was born in Dublin in 1776. Her father was the Irish Catholic playwright John O'Keeffe and her mother was the Protestant actress Mary Heaphy. Adelaide and her brother came under her father's care after her parents' marriage ended. As Donelle Ruwe writes in her study of O'Keeffe's life and works: ""When Adelaide was six, her father lost his eyesight and discovered that his wife was having an affair with a Scottish actor named George Graham. Enraged, John O'Keeffe left Ireland forever, taking his children with him.""  Mary Heaphy later married Graham, for she felt that, as a Protestant, her first union with a Catholic was ""not sufficiently binding to prevent a subsequent marriage."" When Mary secretly visited the children, O'Keeffe was, in Adelaide's own words, ""inflamed with jealousy"" and sent both children to France. Seven year-old Adelaide went to a French convent, and there she stayed until the outbreak of the French revolution five years later. Twelve-year-old Adelaide returned to England, and she never again was far from her father. She served as his amanuensis, and she supported him through her earnings as a governess and an author for almost forty-five years until his death in 1833. As her father's amanuensis, Adelaide O'Keeffe would have recorded his work The Farmer in 1787; Wild Oats in 1791 and in 1795 The Wicklow Mountains.
O'Keeffe's first published work is the historical novel Llewellin: A Tale, and throughout her writing career, she would return to the historical fiction form, often seeking out narratives in which her heroes suffered the trauma of a disrupted childhood, often caused by the separation of the hero's parents, as is the case with her final novel  The Broken Sword, or, A Soldier’s Honour: A Tale of the Allied Armies of 1757. O'Keeffe's second novel, Zenobia, Queen of Palmyra; a Narrative, Founded on History, is particularly interesting to scholars today, for it features a powerful queen from the Roman empire. Zenobia, as depicted by O'Keeffe, is taught multiple religions (and also teaches others, including her husband) as she converts from paganism, to Judaism, and finally to Christianity. As Donelle Ruwe suggests, although Zenobia's final conversion to Christianity is intended to prove that Christianity is the superior religion, the fact the same pedagogical lessons and approaches are used to sway her from one religion to another ultimately calls into question the very nature of religious belief. O'Keeffe's third novel, Dudley (1819), is set in contemporary times, and it, too, emphasizes discussions of education. It is modeled directly after Adèle et Théodore, ou Lettres sur l'éducation (1782) by Stéphanie Félicité, comtesse de Genlis (translated as Adelaide and Theodore). O'Keeffe's most famous prose work is a retelling of the first five books of the Bible, Patriarchal Times; or, The Land of Canaan: a Figurate History (1811).Although O'Keeffe was a successful novelist, her greatest claim to literary fame was for her children's poetry. She was one of the three main contributors to the important two-volume collection, Original Poems for Infant Minds (1804, 1805) along with Ann Taylor and Jane Taylor. She followed this publication with Original Poems: Calculated to Improve the Mind of Youth and Allure it to Virtue (1808), The Old Grand-Papa, and Other Poems, for the Amusement of Youth (1812), National Characters Exhibited in Forty Geographical Poems (1818), A Trip to the Coast. Or Poems Descriptive of Various Interesting Objects on the Sea-Shore (1819), Mamma’s Present of Pictures and Poetry (1820), and Poems for Young Children (1848). Her poem ""Prejudice"" was included in the collection The Hermit and the Traveller (1816) along with poetry by Thomas Parnell and Oliver Goldsmith. In British Children's Poetry of the Romantic Era: Verse, Riddle, and Rhyme (2014), Donelle Ruwe discusses O'Keeffe's many contributions to children's poetry traditions, such as her creation of the children's verse-novel and her use of active learning techniques and innovative verse forms.O'Keeffe died unmarried in 1865 in Brighton. For the last few years she had been sustained by grants from the Literary Fund.

== Construction and design details ==
Point Jefferson was built to accommodate an 8-man crew. She was powered by two 600 hp (447 kW) VT600 Cummins diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed 42 in (1.1 m) propellers. The main drive engines were later replaced by 800 hp (597 kW) VT800 Cummins engines. Water tank capacity was 1,550 U.S. gallons (5,900 L) and fuel tank capacity was 1,840 U.S. gallons (7,000 L) at 95% full. Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360-degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment.The design specifications for Point Jefferson included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room. Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service. The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly. Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer. The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode. Accommodations for a 13-man crew were installed for Vietnam service.


== History ==
After delivery in 1960, Point Jefferson was assigned a homeport of Nantucket, Massachusetts, where she served as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat. On 18 August 1963, she towed MV Yankee with 149 on board to Provincetown, MA. From 18 October 1964 to 29 January 1965, she served on Cuban patrol.At the request of the United States Navy, in October 1965, she was alerted for service in South Vietnam and assigned to Coast Guard Squadron One in support of Operation Market Time along with 8 other Point class cutters. While the crew completed overseas training and weapons qualifications at Coast Guard Island and Camp Parks, California, Point Jefferson was loaded onto a merchant ship, and transported to Subic Bay, Philippines arriving in January 1966 where she was refitted for combat service. Shipyard modifications included installation of new single-sideband radio equipment, additional floodlights, small arms lockers, bunks, additional sound-powered phone circuits, and the addition of 4 M2 machine guns. The original Oerlikon 20 mm cannon was replaced with a combination over-under .50 caliber machine gun/81mm trigger-fired mortar that had been developed by the Coast Guard for service in Vietnam. For service in Vietnam, two officers were added to the crew complement to add seniority to the crew in the mission of interdicting vessels at sea.Point Jefferson was assigned to Division 13 of Squadron One to be based at Cat Lo Naval Base near Vung Tau, along with USCGC Point Cypress, USCGC Point Grace, USCGC Point Hudson, USCGC Point Kennedy, USCGC Point League, USCGC Point Partridge, USCGC Point Slocum and USCGC Point White. After sea trials, the Division left Subic Bay for Cat Lo on 19 February 1966 in the company of USS Forster, their temporary support ship. They arrived at their new duty station on 23 February and began patrolling the coastal waters near the Rung Sat Special Zone. Duty consisted of boarding Vietnamese junks to search for contraband weapons and ammunition and check the identification papers of persons on board.
In early 1970, Point Jefferson and Point Partridge acting as a team made over 300 boardings. Civic action programs conducted during the boardings by the two Squadron One cutters included handing out 3000 bars of soap as well as food items. Twelve Vietnamese were given medical treatment.After the crew of Point Jefferson trained a Vietnamese replacement crew, she was turned over to the Republic of Vietnam Navy as a part of the Vietnamization Program and recommissioned as RVNS Lê Ngọc Ẩn (HQ-712), 21 February 1970.

Stratigraphy has three related subfields: lithostratigraphy (lithologic stratigraphy), biostratigraphy (biologic stratigraphy), and chronostratigraphy (stratigraphy by age).


== Historical development ==

Catholic priest Nicholas Steno established the theoretical basis for stratigraphy when he introduced the law of superposition, the principle of original horizontality and the principle of lateral continuity in a 1669 work on the fossilization of organic remains in layers of sediment.
The first practical large-scale application of stratigraphy was by William Smith in the 1790s and early 19th century. Known as the ""Father of English geology"", Smith recognized the significance of strata or rock layering and the importance of fossil markers for correlating strata; he created the first geologic map of England. Other influential applications of stratigraphy in the early 19th century were by Georges Cuvier and Alexandre Brongniart, who studied the geology of the region around Paris.


== Lithostratigraphy ==

Variation in rock units, most obviously displayed as visible layering, is due to physical contrasts in rock type (lithology). This variation can occur vertically as layering (bedding), or laterally, and reflects changes in environments of deposition (known as facies change). These variations provide a lithostratigraphy or lithologic stratigraphy of the rock unit. Key concepts in stratigraphy involve understanding how certain geometric relationships between rock layers arise and what these geometries imply about their original depositional environment. The basic concept in stratigraphy, called the law of superposition, states: in an undeformed stratigraphic sequence, the oldest strata occur at the base of the sequence.
Chemostratigraphy studies the changes in the relative proportions of trace elements and isotopes within and between lithologic units. Carbon and oxygen isotope ratios vary with time, and researchers can use those to map subtle changes that occurred in the paleoenvironment. This has led to the specialized field of isotopic stratigraphy.
Cyclostratigraphy documents the often cyclic changes in the relative proportions of minerals (particularly carbonates), grain size, thickness of sediment layers (varves) and fossil diversity with time, related to seasonal or longer term changes in palaeoclimates.


== Biostratigraphy ==

Biostratigraphy or paleontologic stratigraphy is based on fossil evidence in the rock layers. Strata from widespread locations containing the same fossil fauna and flora are said to be correlatable in time. Biologic stratigraphy was based on William Smith's principle of faunal succession, which predated, and was one of the first and most powerful lines of evidence for, biological evolution. It provides strong evidence for the formation (speciation) and extinction of species. The geologic time scale was developed during the 19th century, based on the evidence of biologic stratigraphy and faunal succession. This timescale remained a relative scale until the development of radiometric dating, which was based on an absolute time framework, leading to the development of chronostratigraphy.
One important development is the Vail curve, which attempts to define a global historical sea-level curve according to inferences from worldwide stratigraphic patterns. Stratigraphy is also commonly used to delineate the nature and extent of hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir rocks, seals, and traps of petroleum geology.


== Chronostratigraphy ==

Chronostratigraphy is the branch of stratigraphy that places an absolute age, rather than a relative age on rock strata. The branch is concerned with deriving geochronological data for rock units, both directly and inferentially, so that a sequence of time-relative events that created the rocks formation can be derived. The ultimate aim of chronostratigraphy is to place dates on the sequence of deposition of all rocks within a geological region, and then to every region, and by extension to provide an entire geologic record of the Earth.
A gap or missing strata in the geological record of an area is called a stratigraphic hiatus. This may be the result of a halt in the deposition of sediment. Alternatively, the gap may be due to removal by erosion, in which case it may be called a stratigraphic vacuity. It is called a hiatus because deposition was on hold for a period of time. A physical gap may represent both a period of non-deposition and a period of erosion.  A geologic fault may cause the appearance of a hiatus.


=== Magnetostratigraphy ===

Magnetostratigraphy is a chronostratigraphic technique used to date sedimentary and volcanic sequences. The method works by collecting oriented samples at measured intervals throughout a section. The samples are analyzed to determine their detrital remanent magnetism (DRM), that is, the polarity of Earth's magnetic field at the time a stratum was deposited. For sedimentary rocks this is possible because, as they fall through the water column, very fine-grained magnetic minerals (< 17 μm) behave like tiny compasses, orienting themselves with Earth's magnetic field. Upon burial, that orientation is preserved. For volcanic rocks, magnetic minerals, which form in the melt, orient themselves with the ambient magnetic field, and are fixed in place upon crystallization of the lava.
Oriented paleomagnetic core samples are collected in the field; mudstones, siltstones, and very fine-grained sandstones are the preferred lithologies because the magnetic grains are finer and more likely to orient with the ambient field during deposition. If the ancient magnetic field were oriented similar to today's field (North Magnetic Pole near the North Rotational Pole), the strata would retain a normal polarity. If the data indicate that the North Magnetic Pole were near the South Rotational Pole, the strata would exhibit reversed polarity.
Results of the individual samples are analyzed by removing the natural remanent magnetization (NRM) to reveal the DRM. Following statistical analysis, the results are used to generate a local magnetostratigraphic column that can then be compared against the Global Magnetic Polarity Time Scale.
This technique is used to date sequences that generally lack fossils or interbedded igneous rocks. The continuous nature of the sampling means that it is also a powerful technique for the estimation of sediment-accumulation rates.

== Origin ==
The nomen Ignius is derived from ignis, fire, and belongs to a large class of gentilicia derived from the names of ordinary objects, although as is often the case, one cannot determine from the name whether the original bearer was so called because he was vigorous, temperamental, had red hair, or resembled fire in some other respect.  Although a great number of Ignii appear in inscriptions from Gaul, several come from the towns of Beneventum and Aeclanum in Samnium, indicating that the Ignii were likely descended from the Samnites, or perhaps from Latin colonists in the region.


== Praenomina ==
The main praenomina of the Ignii were Aulus, Quintus, Lucius, and Gaius, all of which were common throughout Roman history.  Aulus is found among the Ignii in Samnium; elsewhere they relied on Quintus, Lucius, and Gaius, although there is an instance of Sextus from Gallia Narbonensis.

== Formation ==
As part of Sega's ""support program for independent game creators"", Yuji Naka left Sega's Sonic Team studio to start his own studio, joined by ten Sonic Team members. It had a starting capital of 10 million yen, 10% of which came from Sega in exchange for the right of first refusal for publishing Prope games. Prope was founded on May 23, 2006 and it began operations on June 1, 2006.Prope intended to create games with a graphical style that appealed to both children and adults, and to explore the possibilities of developing both 3D and 2D games. Naka joined Square Enix in January 2018, leaving the status of Prope uncertain. In March 2019, Naka confirmed that Prope had been reduced to a one-person company since the end of April 2017. Yuji Naka released SHOT2048 under the Prope brand in December 2021.


== Games ==
Previously, the studio had been consistently linked with a sequel to Nights into Dreams..., though Nights: Journey of Dreams was ultimately developed by Sega Studio USA. Naka has claimed in an interview that he presently has no intention to revisit any of his former Sega properties.Prope's first two titles, the Wii rhythm game Let's Tap, and the WiiWare game Let's Catch, were both released in December 2008. Both games were published by Sega.
After a series of simplistic iOS games such as 10 Count Boxer and Fluffy Bear, under the iPrope label, Prope's next major game Ivy the Kiwi? was released in November 2009 exclusively for Windows Phone, with Microsoft publishing it. In April 2009, it was ported to WiiWare and DSiWare and published by Namco Bandai in Japan, Xseed Games in America and Rising Star Games in Europe as Prope's parent company Sega refused to publish the game and Namco Bandai decided not to publish the game outside Asia. In 2010, an expanded physical release (in contrast to a digital one) was released for Wii  and Nintendo DS, featuring 50 levels (whereas the downloadable version featured 25) as well as original backgrounds and music for each level.
In 2011, Prope released Real Ski Jump, which, as of 2014, had been downloaded 4 million times.

All songs written by Kate Nash


== Chart positions ==
Each copy of ""Merry Happy"" had a number from 1–1000 printed on it. A competition was held on the official Kate Nash website, where fans who bought a copy of 'Merry Happy' with a winning number on it would win the chance for Kate Nash to customize their copy for them. The 10 winning numbers were posted on katenash.co.uk. The competition boosted single sales only slightly, as ""Merry Happy"" was not commercially successful, peaking at 116 in the UK Singles Chart. In the United States the song managed to chart on the Bubbling Under chart at #12, while charting at #97 on the Pop 100 due to digital downloads fueled by the album's promotion on iTunes the week of its release.

Position number 12 on the Bubbling Under Chart is the equivalent of 112 on the Hot 100.

Spiculum,"['All articles lacking sources', 'All stub articles', 'Ancient Roman legionary equipment', 'Ancient Roman military stubs', 'Ancient weapons', 'Articles lacking sources from April 2008', 'Javelins', 'Polearm stubs', 'Roman spears']","A spiculum is a late Roman spear that replaced the pilum as the infantryman's main throwing javelin around 250 AD. Scholars suppose that it could have resulted from the gradual combination of the pilum and two German spears, the angon and the bebra. As more and more Germans joined the Roman army, their culture and traditions became a driving force for change. The spiculum was better than the old pilum when used as a thrusting spear, but still maintained some of the former weapon's penetrative power when thrown.
Vegetius mentions the spiculum in his military manual, but some scholars maintain that the spiculum was simply a different name for the pilum. Whatever the case, most historians accept that the spiculum evolved from the earlier javelins used by the Roman army.
The main difference between the spiculum and the pilum was the length of the thin point. The spiculum tended to have a much shorter iron point. Thus, the spiculum was a bit shorter than its ancestor, perhaps 190 cm long. The spiculum had a medium iron shank attached to the head. Its exact design is not fully known as there were many variants. The spiculum fell out of favour with the Roman army some time after 400 AD.","A spiculum is a late Roman spear that replaced the pilum as the infantryman's main throwing javelin around 250 AD.

== IMELI ==

The IMELI building, an example of the Stalin-era Socialist Classicism, was constructed in Tbilisi, the capital of then-Soviet Georgia, between 1934 and 1938 based on the design by Alexey Shchusev to house a Tbilisi-branch of the Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute. IMELI (იმელი) is a Georgian rendition of the Institute's Russian name acronymed as IMEL (Russian: ИМЭЛ), which remained colloquial in Tbilisi even after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Shchusev's design was eclectic, featuring elements of both Socialist Classicism and Constructivism. Both the exterior and interior are richly decorated with wooden and metal works, as well as with various Georgian marbles and natural stones. The facades were adorned by the leading Georgian sculptors of that time—Iakob Nikoladze and Tamar Abakelia. In 1986 the building was listed as architectural heritage.After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the building was used for government purposes and some Communist-era symbols and decorations were removed from the facades. It housed the Parliament of Georgia from 1992 to 1995. It was where the Georgia's first post-Soviet constitution was adopted on 25 August 1995. Later, it served as the Constitutional Court of Georgia and the Central Election Commission office.In 2007, after briefly considering reconstruction of the IMELI building to house the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it was delisted by the government of Georgia and sold to the Capital Vostok company with the intention to build a luxury five-star Kempinski hotel. The suggested architectural development was designed by Berlin-based architects Christoph Kohl and Rob Krier. In the process of renovation, the investor started to demolish the building without due permission and IMELI lost a number of its original elements, leading to a series of protests from preservationists. 
By 2008, the project had staggered and the building was sold to the Abu Dhabi United Group, which agreed to stop demolition and preserve the historical façade of the building. In 2011, Tbilisi City Hall gave permission to the new investor to construct, next to the Shchusev building, a 138-metre glass skyscraper, which now towers over the largely 19th and early 20th-century architecture of Rustaveli Avenue and is connected to the IMELI building via a glass walkway.

It was also used as the title song of the 2014 Broadway musical Beautiful: The Carole King Musical.


== Lyrics and music ==
According to King, she did not consciously attempt to write ""Beautiful"" but it came to her spontaneously.  It stemmed from her realization while riding the New York City Subway that the way she perceived others reflected how she herself felt.  She has also stated that because it came to her spontaneously, she initially didn't realize some of the professional details of the song, such as the lack of rhyme in the refrain, which if she was writing the song consciously she would have included.Rolling Stone Magazine critic Jon Landau describes ""Beautiful"" as an ""uptempo song.""  The lyrics reflect themes present throughout the Tapestry album, such as the importance of self-esteem and positive outlook.  Within the song, beauty is defined not as an attractive outward appearance but as inner beauty.  In the verses of the song, the singer sings about the unhappy people she sees around her.  The message is emphasized by setting the verses in a minor key and to a straightforward rhythm and singing at a relatively low pitch.  The refrain, describes the need for optimism and self-esteem in order to be successful, and is reinforced by being set in a major key and to a syncopated rhythm and at a higher pitch.Instrumentation for ""Beautiful"" includes King playing piano and synthesizer, Charles Larkey on bass guitar, Joel O'Brien on drums and Danny Kortchmar on conga drums.  Author James Perone praises the song as ""great sleeper track"" but criticizes the use of the synthesizer, which although not prominent he believes sounds synthetic, detracting from the song's emphasis on being real.  Rolling Stone Album Guide critic Mark Coleman states that King's performance ""rescues 'Beautiful' from the sentimental deep end.""

== History ==


=== Commodore Hotel ===
The Commodore Hotel was developed as part of ""Terminal City"", a complex of palatial hotels and offices connected to Grand Central Terminal and all owned by the New York State Realty and Terminal Company (NYSRTC), a division of the New York Central Railroad (NYCRR). The Commodore was named after ""Commodore"" Cornelius Vanderbilt, the founder of NYCRR; a statue of Vanderbilt is located outside the hotel. The Commodore was designed by Warren & Wetmore and leased by the NYSRTC to the Bowman-Biltmore Hotels Corporation, of which John McEntee Bowman was president.

The Commodore opened on January 28, 1919. Herbert R. Stone, of NYSRTC, oversaw the decor of its 2,000 rooms. The lobby, called the ""Most Beautiful Lobby in The World,"" was the single largest room in the hotel, with modern low ceilings and a waterfall designed by John B. Smeraldi. A group of conventioneers once told Bowman that ""New York City was like a circus,"" so the next day Bowman, ever a showman, arranged to place a circus, complete with elephants, in the grand ballroom. Another popular spot was the Century Room, which boasted its own orchestra. The Commodore shared a parking garage with its sister hotel, the New York Biltmore Hotel, which had been Bowman-Biltmore's first hotel investment. Another Terminal City property – The Roosevelt Hotel, originally a United Hotel asset – merged with Bowman-Biltmore Corporation on March 4, 1929, giving Terminal City access to all railroad passenger traffic in and out of New York City. One notable person to have stayed at The Commodore was Albert Einstein, who stayed at the hotel for a few weeks in April 1921 during his tour of the east coast of the U.S. promoting the creation of Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
The Commodore was successful for decades, and in June 1967, NYCRR – which by then was running the hotel through a division called Realty Hotels – upgraded the Commodore with a 3.4 million-dollar refurbishment. On May 10, 1972, while John R. Garside was the hotel's general manager, the Commodore became the first hotel in New York City to show in-room movies through Player Cinema Systems. However, by the late 1970s, both the railroad (now Penn Central, following merger with the Pennsylvania Railroad) and the hotel had become less successful. On May 11, 1977, the now-bankrupt railroad's asset manager, Victor Palmieri, told the city that the Commodore had lost $1.5 million in 1976 and might have to be shuttered.
At that point, Donald Trump reached an option agreement with Penn Central to purchase the Commodore. Trump, however, did not have the $250,000 necessary to secure the option. Nevertheless, Trump's father, Fred Trump, had a long time political connection through the Brooklyn Democratic machine to then-Mayor Abraham Beame. Despite the city being in the midst of the worst fiscal crisis in its history, Beame's deputy mayor, Stanley Friedman, pushed through a 40-year, $400 million tax abatement on the property. Asked by city officials to supply a copy of the agreement with Penn Central, Trump sent the option agreement paperwork minus the signatures. The abatement moved forward as if the agreement had been signed and as if Trump had paid to secure the option. Trump was then able to convince the Hyatt hotel chain to partner with the Trump Organization and purchase the Commodore.


=== Conversion into Grand Hyatt ===

The Trump Organization rebuilt the hotel at a cost of US$100 million, gutting the first few floors of the interior down to their steel frame (although the same basic layout of public rooms was retained) and placing a new reflective glass facade on top of the existing masonry exterior. The work was done by the firm of Gruzen Samton, with architect Der Scutt, who would later design Trump Tower, serving as design consultant. The only portion of the hotel's decor left untouched was the foyer to the grand ballroom, with its neoclassical columns and plasterwork.
Trump had originally told the architects that he wanted a ""big atrium"", but this was not possible since they were retaining the building's 1919 support structure, which contained many interior columns.The renovated hotel featured a restaurant cantilevered over the 42nd street sidewalk, This was included in the plan which Trump got approved in 1976 by the New York City Board of Estimate to rebuild the hotel.The hotel re-opened on September 25, 1980, as the Grand Hyatt New York, with Governor of New York Hugh Carey and Mayor of New York City Ed Koch in attendance. The new facade was criticized as out of place and as having destroyed the character of East 42nd Street. The Architectural Guidebook to New York City referred to the facade as a “mirror box” and an “utter and inexcusable outrage.” The Guidebook continued:

The old Commodore was a brick and masonry structure of appropriately modest and deferential design. The Grand Hyatt imposes its garish vacuity with a painful lack of concern about the way it relates to one of the most architecturally significant streets in America.
In 1989, New York State officials ordered the hotel to pay New York City $2.9 million in rent that had been withheld by the hotel in 1986 due to ""unusual"" accounting changes approved by Donald Trump. An investigation by New York City auditors noted that the hotel was missing basic financial records and found that the hotel was using procedures that violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
The Trump/Hyatt partnership eventually collapsed, with Trump filing a civil racketeering suit against Hyatt owner Jay Pritzker on July 28, 1993, alleging that Hyatt had used improper accounting practices, in order to force Trump out of the partnership with Hyatt, which restricted the chain from operating any other convention hotel in New York City. The Pritzkers countersued on March 28, 1994, alleging that Trump had violated their partnership by failing to remain solvent, using his share in the hotel as collateral for bank loans, and refusing to cover his share of the cost of necessary repairs.  The much-needed renovation of the hotel finally began on April 8, 1996, and continued through that August. Finally, on October 7, 1996, the Pritzkers bought Trump's half-share in the hotel for $142 million, ending the partnership.The hotel won the 2007 and 2008 Corporate and Incentive Travel magazine ""Award of Excellence."" It was completely renovated in 2011, at a cost of $130 million, at which point the 1980s modern interiors were removed. The renovation was complicated by the structure's 1919 origins, including 138 different guest-room configurations.


=== Project Commodore ===
The replacement of the Grand Hyatt New York hotel was announced in February 2019. The hotel will be demolished as part of a project by TF Cornerstone, MSD Partners and RXR Realty, subject to the approval of the state and the city, though no final agreement had been signed. A new 2,600,000-square-foot (240,000 m2) mixed-use structure with office and retail space, as well as a smaller hotel, would be built on the site. The development would require transfer of the lease on the property from Hyatt, which holds it through 2077.The hotel closed temporarily in March 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In November 2020, preliminary plans for an 83-story mixed-use tower called Project Commodore were announced on the site of the Grand Hyatt New York. The tower, designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, would be 1,646 feet (502 m) tall making it the second-tallest in New York City if completed. The structure would contain office space on the 7th through 63rd floors and a 500-room Grand Hyatt hotel on the 65th through 83rd floors. The basement, first, and second floors would contain retail, while the first floor would also contain a transit hall leading to Grand Central Terminal and the New York City Subway's Grand Central–42nd Street station. A public plaza and a stair to the Park Avenue Viaduct would also be built. If approved the projected timeline for the project has 18 months for demolition and 47 months of construction with a preliminary completion date in 2030.  Preliminary renderings of the street levels of the tower and transit hall and design concept for the tower were released in February 2021.

The hotel reopened on November 1, 2021, rebranded as Hyatt Grand Central New York. The reopening before the hotel's planned demolition is partly due to legislation passed by the New York City Council, which requires hotels that closed due to the pandemic to pay severance to their employees if they do not reopen with at least 25% of their former staff. The hotel's closure date for demolition has now been set for no earlier than 2023.

== Foundation ==
The party was formed in early December 2020 by Alaa Al Rikabi, a doctor and civil activist with other civil activists inside a tent in Al-Haboubi Square, the stronghold of the 2019–2021 Iraqi protests in the center of Dhi Qar governorate. The idea was establishing a youth civil movement as an alternative to the current political parties that have failed to run the country and have been implicated in crimes of financial corruption, fueling sectarianism and racism, and creating various crises in the country since 2003. The announcement of the movement came in January 2021 and was called  ""extension"", indicating that the movement's premise stemmed from the demands of the protesters, who demanded the end of sectarianism and state corrupion.

2021 Iraqi parliamentary election
Although the movement got nearly 300,000 votes, that turned out to be only 9 seats due to the bad distribution of candidates in the pools.

== Gun groups ==
Gun groups were known as teppo tai. Teppo (鉄砲) meaning gun and tai meaning group, or unit.
Recently the general media has come to view the samurai as warriors who were armed only with close combat weapons such as the katana.[2] However, the Japanese were arguably using guns more effectively than their European counterparts by the sixteenth century, as well as producing more accurate, durable varieties. 
The Battle of Nagashino, where guns were deployed against samurai cavalry, is one of the most famous and influential battles in the history of the samurai.


== Ashigaru ==

The ashigaru were the lowest class of soldier in feudal Japan and were formed as militia units during times of conflict. The arrival of guns in Japan in 1543 greatly increased the capability of the ashigaru units on the battlefield. Prior to the introduction of firearms, these men would often have to wield polearms and spears like yari or learn to fight with swords and bows. The matchlock, or tanegashima (gun) by comparison was easier to use. It did not rely on physical strength or regular practice to be effective. In addition the firearms could be stockpiled in great numbers when not required. As such, samurai and professional soldiers would train the lower classes in hōjutsu.

The three manufactures of these specialized computers are Brunswick Bowling, AMF Bowling and RCA.


== History ==

Automatic equipment is considered a cornerstone of the modern bowling center. The traditional bowling center of the early 20th century was advanced in automation when the pinsetter person (""pin boy""), who set back up by hand the bowled down pins, was replaced by a machine that automatically replaced the pins in their proper play positions. This machine came out in the 1950s. A detection system was developed from the pinsetter mechanism in the 1960s that could tell which pins had been knocked down, and that information could be transferred to a digital computer.Automatic electronic scoring was first conceived by Robert Reynolds, an electronic calculator expert. He worked with Brunswick Bowling technicians to develop it. It was realized in the late 1960s when a specialized computer was designed for the purpose of automatic scorekeeping for bowling. This increased the popularity of the sport. The automatic scorer was first field tested at Village Lanes bowling center, Chicago in 1967. The scoring machine received approval for official use by the American Bowling Congress in August of that year. They were first used in national official league gaming on October 10, 1967.  In November Brunswick announced that they were accepting orders for the new digital computer, which cost around $3,000 per bowling lane. Bowling centers that installed these new automatic scoring devices in the 1970s charged a dime extra per line of scoring for the convenience. California was considered the best prospect for making the first sales since it was the only state where bowlers paid an individual for league scorekeeping.


== Description ==

Each Automatic Scorer computer unit kept score for four lanes. It had two bowler identification panels serving two lanes each. The bowler pushed it into his named position when his turn came up so the computer knew who was bowling and score accordingly. After the bowler rolled the bowling ball down the lane and knocked down pins, the pinsetter detected which pins were down and relayed this information back to the computer for scoring. It was then printed on a scoresheet and projected overhead onto a large screen for all to see.The Automatic Scorer digital computer was mathematically accurate, however the detection system at the pinsetter mechanism sometimes reported the wrong number of pins knocked down. The computer could be corrected manually for this as well as handicap figures added and late arriving bowlers tallied. The automatic scoring is directly connected to the foul detection unit so that foul line violations are automatically scored.Brunswick put in ten years of research and developed a computer that kept the score of bowling and labeled it the Automatic Scorer. By 1972 there were over 500 of these computers installed in bowling centers worldwide. AMF Bowling, competitor to Brunswick, entered into the automatic scorer computer field in 1973 and their systems were installed into their brand of bowling centers. AMF and Brunswick each had their set of Customer Service Engineers in a territorial area that repaired the computers. By 1974 RCA was also making these computers for automatic scoring.


== Reception ==
The purposes of the computerized scoring were to avoid errors by human scorers and to prevent cheating. It had the side benefit of speeding up the progress of the game and introducing new bowlers to the game. Score-keeping for bowling is based on a formula that many new to bowling were not familiar with and thought difficult to learn. These casual bowlers unfamiliar with the formula thought the scores given by the computers were confusing. Some bowlers did not trust automatic scorers when they were introduced in the 1970s, so kept score using the traditional method on paper score sheets to verify the accuracy of the reporting.Automatic scorers are considered the normal part of modern bowling installations worldwide. The owners and managers say that bowlers expect these scoring system computers in 21st century bowling establishments. Many state that business has increased since their introduction. The traditional 'bowling alleys' have become known as 'bowling centers' since the introduction of the color television style automatic scorer in 1983.  These type of electronic visual displays show bowler avatars and social media connections to publish the bowlers' scores. Bowling center owners can use these style automatic scorers for advertising, management, videos, and live television. Some are capable of being extended entertainment systems of games for children and adults.The automatic scoring bowling computers of the 21st century detect electronically if a bowling pin has been knocked down. This is done with fluorescent coatings on the outer surface of the wooden pins. This is an ionomer cladding material put on a preselected area of the bowling pin, usually in the neck portion. It consists of a particular type of coating that emits a high level of light when hit with ultraviolet light. Another coating is put on the pin that emits a moon-glow and thereby amplifies the first coating's light by the contrast. This then makes it detectable by an electronic sensor if the pin is still standing. That detected pin or knocked down pin is a signal sent back to the automatic scorer computer for the tally and keeps score for the bowler.

Coercive logic,"['All stub articles', 'Articles with short description', 'CS1 errors: missing periodical', 'Logic puzzles', 'Logic stubs', 'Short description matches Wikidata']","Coercive logic is a concept popularised by mathematician Raymond Smullyan, by which a person who has agreed to answer a question truthfully is forced to perform an undesired action, where not doing so would mean breaking their agreement. Smullyan presents the concept as a question:

If so, you shouldn't, for I would then ask: Will you either answer no to this question or pay me two million dollars?

An official video associated with the remix was filmed on September 19, 2007, and released in early October. The video premiered on VH1's Top 20 Countdown on October 27, 2007. The video was directed by Robert Hales and was shot in a recording studio showing OneRepublic performing the song. The video also includes scenes from a New Year's Eve countdown party, starring actor Brian A. Pollack. In a third version of the video, also directed by Robert Hales and associated with the remix, Timbaland is portrayed remixing the song himself. A European version of the video features clips of the film Keinohrhasen, starring Til Schweiger. A Japanese version of the video was also made available for a short time. It features the same footage as the original but has more scenes from different camera angles. It also features footage of people falling and floating in the air in slow motion. The music video currently has 417.02 million views.

""Apologize"" was OneRepublic's breakout hit. In the United States, ""Apologize"" peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 for four non-consecutive weeks, first blocked from the top spot for two weeks by Chris Brown's ""Kiss Kiss"" and then for two weeks by Alicia Keys' ""No One"". It spent 11 weeks at number three and 25 weeks inside the top 10 and peaked at number three for 10 weeks on the Hot 100 Airplay. It also topped the Billboard Pop 100 and became the third single from Shock Value to have topped the chart. It also became the album's first number-one single on the Billboard Adult Top 40. It is also the second consecutive single from Shock Value to reach number one on the US Mainstream Top 40 radio. It became only the tenth song to sell over 5 million by May 2011 in the US. As of February 2014, it had sold 5,819,000 copies. In late 2009, the song was ranked in tenth place on the Billboard Hot 100 Decade-End chart, making it the highest-ranking song and the only top-10 ranking song on there to not top the weekly Billboard Hot 100 chart.
In the UK, ""Apologize"" climbed to number 32 on the strength of digital downloads alone, and peaked at number three. The song spent 28 consecutive weeks in the top 40 and 13 weeks in the top 10. The song ended 2007 as the year's sixteenth biggest selling single in Britain. In Australia, the single debuted at number 10 on the ARIA Singles Chart, and peaked at number one. It stayed at the top for eight consecutive weeks, and was certified 4x Platinum by ARIA. The song reached number one on both the Canadian Hot 100 and New Zealand RIANZ Chart. It is the most downloaded single of all time in Australia and New Zealand. On Billboard's official European Hot 100 Singles chart, the song debuted at number 16, making it the highest debut chart position of any new act in the history of the chart. It later entered the top 10. The song went gold in Russia with 100,000 copies sold.In Germany, the song was downloaded 437,000 times, making it the third best-selling download single of all time behind Lady Gaga's ""Poker Face"" and Lena Meyer-Landrut's ""Satellite"".

== Biography ==
Mireille Dansereau was a dancer for 15 years before turning to filmmaking. After finishing her studies at the University of Montreal, she made her first film, a short entitled Moi, un jour... for Expo 67. The film was well received and enabled her to move to London, England to attend the Royal College of Art. She obtained her master's degree in Film and Television and made another short film, Compromise,  which won first prize at the 1969 Great Britain Student Film Festival. Dansereau worked a variety of jobs - researcher, script assistant, sound recorder - before returning to Quebec. There, she co-founded L’Association Coopérative des Productions Audio-visuelles (ACPAV) and became the first woman in Quebec to direct a fiction feature film in the private sector; the film, La vie rêvée (1971) was produced by the ACPAV and became a landmark that received a wide theatrical release and national critical acclaim.She joined the NFB following her success and directed 2 feature documentaries for the En tant que femmes Series, J'me marie, j'me marie pas (1973) and Famille et variations (1977). She returned to the private sector to direct her next fiction feature, L'Arrache-Coeur (1979), a bleak, and penetrating examination of a marriage in crisis which earned Dansereau a Genie Award for Best Screenplay nomination, and Le Sourd dans la ville (1987), a dark, disturbing and experimental adaptation of Marie-Claire Blais's novel centered on a rooming house.

","Víctor Hugo Andrada Canalis (born 25 December 1958 in Santa Fe), nicknamed Copito, is an Argentine football manager and former player who played as a midfielder. He is the current manager of Bolivian club Real Tomayapo.


== Club career ==
In his native country he played professional football for Colón de Santa Fe, Gimnasia y Esgrima de La Plata, Racing Club de Avellaneda and Unión de Santa Fe, but the neighbouring country of Bolivia is where he spent most of his extensive career, playing for teams such as, Blooming, The Strongest, San José, Destroyers and Real Potosí. He also made a short spell in the Liga Chilena de Fútbol with Unión Española.


== Managerial career ==
Following his retirement, ""Copito"" pursued a career as a football manager in Bolivia. In 2005, he took over club Real Potosí, but he was sacked due to poor results. In 2007, he made his comeback with Nacional Potosí, but the team fell short from winning the promotion after losing in a two-game series to Guabirá. Nevertheless, Andrada got his recognition in 2008 as he took the team back to the Copa Simón Bolivar finals; only this time, his team came victorious. Therefore, gained promotion to the Liga de Fútbol Profesional Boliviano for the first time in the club's history. The next year Andrada had an explosive start in first division with Nacional, leading the standings during the first ten weeks; however, the team began to stagger and eventually fell behind. On June 14, 2009, after 18 games into the season, Andrada resigned from his job in protest to constant intrusion of the board of directors in team affairs. On July 6, 2009 he assumed his managerial duties with Blooming, where he won the national league title of Clausura 2009, defeating Bolívar in the final match.

ACES (computational chemistry),"['All stub articles', 'Computational chemistry software', 'Physical chemistry stubs', 'Quantum physics stubs', 'Theoretical chemistry stubs', 'University of Florida']","Aces II (Advanced Concepts in Electronic Structure Theory) is an ab initio computational chemistry package for performing high-level quantum chemical ab initio calculations. Its major strength is the accurate calculation of atomic and molecular energies as well as properties using many-body techniques such as many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) and, in particular coupled cluster techniques to treat electron correlation. The development of ACES II began in early 1990 in the group of Professor Rodney J. Bartlett at the Quantum Theory Project (QTP) of the University of Florida in Gainesville. There, the need for more efficient codes had been realized and the idea of writing an entirely new program package emerged. During 1990 and 1991 John F. Stanton, Jürgen Gauß, and John D. Watts, all of them at that time postdoctoral researchers in the Bartlett group, supported by a few students, wrote the backbone of what is now known as the ACES II program package. The only parts which were not new coding efforts were the integral packages (the MOLECULE package of J. Almlöf, the VPROP package of P.R. Taylor, and the integral derivative package ABACUS of T. Helgaker, P. Jorgensen J. Olsen, and H.J. Aa. Jensen).   The latter was modified extensively for adaptation with Aces II, while the others remained very much in their original forms.
Ultimately, two different versions of the program evolved.   The first was maintained by the Bartlett group at the University of Florida, and the other (known as ACESII-MAB) was maintained by groups at the University of Texas, Universitaet Mainz in Germany, and ELTE in Budapest, Hungary.   The latter is now called CFOUR.
Aces III is a parallel implementation that was released in the fall of 2008.  The effort led to definition of a new architecture for scalable parallel software called the super instruction architecture. The design and creation of software is divided into two parts:

The algorithms are coded in a domain specific language called super instruction assembly language or SIAL, pronounced ""sail"" for easy communication.
The SIAL programs are executed by a MPMD parallel virtual machine called the super instruction processor or SIP.The ACES III program consists of 580,000 lines of SIAL code of which 200,000 lines are comments, and 230,000 lines of C/C++ and Fortran of which 62,000 lines are comments.

The critic felt both Alden and Hutton were ""a little undecided from time to time as to whether a stage-acting or a film-acting technique was required of them. But, with television acting being such a difficult combination of both kinds of playing, they were fortunate to have the guidance of a producer like Raymond Menmuir, and the net outcome of the production, though finally a little flat and disappointing, was an entertainment of stature, substance and challenge.""

== Career ==
Nicolai was born in Berlin to Friederike Sophie Riemer and her husband Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Nicolai, a member of the Ober-Finanzrat (Upper Finance Council) and director of the Prussian maritime trading company. He was educated in the Gymnasium in Königsberg in der Neumark, attending the Gymnasium and receiving instruction from the organist Gracht Unterricht. He returned to Berlin in 1812, spending a short time at the Graues Kloster and receiving piano lessons Johann Philipp Schmidt. In 1813 he fought in the Napoleonic Wars and then studied under Friedrich Wilhelm Berner in Breslau. From 1820 to 1843 he was Divisional Auditor in Berlin, before becoming a private tutor.
His friends included the composers Adolf Bernhard Marx, Gaspare Spontini and Carl Loewe, for whom he wrote the oratorio libretto Die Zerstörung von Jerusalem, set to music by Loewe in 1833. Frederick William III of Prussia rewarded Nicolai with a golden box for the same libretto - the king was one of his main supporters, giving him the Gold Medal for Art and Science.
Nicolai became widely known for his travelogue Italien wie es wirklich ist (Italy as it really is, 1834), in which he gave a critical description of the country. He was heavily criticised, including by Friedrich Wilhelm Gubitz. Nicolai unsuccessfully sued for libel against the review Blätter für literarische Unterhaltung of 1 September 1834 (Nr. 244) - the judgement made legal history, defining the right of literary criticism Between 1835 and 1843 he corresponded with Robert Schumann and wrote several essays for the Neue Zeitschrift für Musik.


== Personal life ==
Nicolai's first marriage was to Henriette Dorothea May and after her death his second was to Leopoldine Concordia Cölestine Grothe (1817 – 11 July 1852). They had four children in 1833, 1834, 1836 and 1837 (who all died in infancy), followed by Arthur Gustav (1845–1846), Leontine Catherine Valerie (1848–1868) and Leontine Rosamunde (born 1850). He died in Berlin.

Kyle Broflovski is portrayed as a Jesus-like savior working to save the economy, and Stan Marsh spends much of the episode trying to return a personal Jimmy Buffett Margaritaville machine.

""Margaritaville"" reflected Parker and Stone's belief that most Americans view the economy in the same way as religion, in that it is seldom understood but seen as an important, elusive entity.

== Plot ==
Randy Marsh is trying to teach his son Stan to save money, so he has him deposit $100 into the bank only for it to ""disappear"" moments later when the bank manager invests the money in a money market mutual fund. After Stan is kicked out of line because it is only for bank members who have money, the same thing happens to an elderly woman. When Randy complains to the manager, his money is transferred from his account into a portfolio with Stan and the manager repeats ""Aaaand it's gone!"". A recession then hits the nation and South Park.
At dinner, Randy explains to Stan that the economy is failing due to people spending their money on luxuries. He continues his hypocritical tirade while making himself a margarita in a Margaritaville-brand mixer, the noise of which drowns out his voice for part of the tirade.
People in South Park are struggling with the recent economic downturn, and many people on the street are castigating those whom they would blame. Eric Cartman blames the Jews, claiming they hid the money in a ""Jew Cave"", but Randy convinces everyone to reduce their spending to only the ""bare essentials"" in order to propitiate the economy, justifying his own frivolous purchase by adding that the essentials include margaritas. His recommended changes make the town resemble first-century Galilee.
Kyle Broflovski becomes annoyed, responding that the economy is not actually angry with them, and that they should be out spending money, and continues to preach that the economy only exists as a mental construct, and that people have lost their faith in it because of the recession. He then convinces his friends that if they want the economy to be strong, they must have faith in it. Upon hearing of this heresy, Randy and his makeshift economic council decide that they must kill Kyle. Cartman, in his desire to obtain a copy of Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars, says that he will deliver Kyle to Randy and his friends in exchange for the game.
In a scene resembling that of the Last Supper, Kyle and his friends go out for pizza where he laments that he feels they will not be able to get together like this anymore because he thinks one of his friends will betray him. The next day, Kyle sets up a table with a credit card machine in the town and begins ""paying everybody's debts"" with his American Express Platinum Card. Kyle's mother begs him to stop because he will be in debt for life, but Kyle feels he must to help everybody in the town. After paying for the debts, he passes out and the people carry him to his bed.
Soon enough, the economy takes a turn for the better. Malls and shops start opening again for business and the now debt free people start purchasing again. Randy is shown buying the new Margaritaville with a salsa dispenser (""You pour salsa into the top, and then it dispenses out the bottom!""). The news incorrectly acknowledges President Barack Obama for the sacrifices he made and credits him for bringing these improvements in the economy, leaving Kyle flabbergasted.
As a subplot, Stan spends most of the episode trying to return the aforementioned Margaritaville mixer. The trendy retailer Sur La Table will not accept the return because it was bought on a payment plan, and as Stan tries to find out to whom he can return it, for each person to tell him the debt has been packaged and sold to someone else (much like real-life mortgage-backed securities). Eventually he goes all the way to the United States Treasury, where a group of associates ""consult the charts"" and tell him the mixer is worth $90 trillion. As Stan questions this, one of the treasury workers announces that another insurance company is failing and asks what they should do. They decide they have to ""consult the charts"" again, and Stan follows them inside to a round lit-up game show style board, where the men cut off a chicken's head and let the decapitated chicken run on the board while one of them plays a tune (similar to Yakety Sax) on a kazoo. The chicken falls on the ""bailout!"" spot, so that is what the men do. Angered by the farcical nature of the system, Stan smashes the mixer on the platform by the chicken's body and walks off.


== Production ==

""Margaritaville"" was written and directed by series co-founder Trey Parker. It first aired on March 25, 2009 in the United States on Comedy Central. Parker and fellow co-creator Matt Stone said they had long planned to do an episode about the global recession, and they argued over whether to start the season with an episode about the economy, or ""The Ring,"" an episode mocking the Jonas Brothers, a boy band which had recently grown in popularity. Stone argued the season premiere should focus on the economy because it was the biggest news item at the time, but Parker felt they needed more time to craft the script, and that the Jonas Brothers would be a funny season opener. Stone ultimately agreed, and later admitted it was the right decision. During an interview a few weeks before the episode aired, Stone said, ""That's one of those big things we want to get right. We'll be talking about what kind of social commentary we want to make and do it right.""Parker and Stone originally planned for their economy-related episode to involve Cartman dressing as a superhero named ""The Coon"" and fighting the recession. Eventually, Cartman would discover the recession stemmed from the sale of Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville blenders, and he would have to battle singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett and investor Warren Buffett, who would be portrayed as Jimmy's brother. Eventually, the idea was scrapped, and the superhero elements were incorporated into the episode ""The Coon"", which aired just before ""Margaritaville"". The opening scene of ""The Coon"", in which Cartman discussed the poor economic state of the nation and the election of U.S. President Barack Obama, were left remnants of the original economy-related idea. Certain elements of the original idea, such as the Margaritaville blenders, were eventually incorporated into ""Margaritaville"".As with most South Park episodes, Parker, Stone, and their team created the episode within a week of its broadcast date. The script was not finished until late March 24, the night before the episode aired. ""Margaritaville"" featured a 70-second shot which panned over several characters speaking about the recession on pedestals before finally settling on Randy wearing robes and preaching about the economy. It was the longest shot in South Park history to that point, although it would be surpassed later in the season by ""Dances with Smurfs"", which featured an 86-second single shot in which a South Park elementary student is murdered while reading the morning announcements.Within a week of ""Margaritaville's"" original broadcast date, the online retailer Zazzle and South Park Studios, the official South Park website, released T-shirts and hooded sweatshirts based on ""Margaritaville"", including shirts with Randy dressed in rags saying ""Finger pointing gets us nowhere!"" and ""We must mock The Economy no longer!"" Other shirts included the finance company executive saying ""Ooh, yeah, no, you know what, yeah, no..."" and an image of The Last Supper-inspired pizza dinner between Kyle and his friends.


== Theme ==

""Margaritaville"" is a satire and commentary on the global recession affecting much of the industrialized world at the time of the episode's broadcast on March 25, 2009. Parker and Stone believed many viewed the economy as an important, elusive entity without truly understanding how it works, and felt it mirrored faith in religion. The duo had difficulty writing the script due to their limited familiarity with religion and Christian history, and they relied heavily on executive producer Anne Garefino for help. In describing the economic elements of the episode, they sought assistance from Stone's father, who works as an economist. The scenes in which Stan explains how his Margaritaville blender was purchased on a payment plan that was eventually combined into securities sold to the banks required particular assistance from Stone's father. Parker said the dialogue proved so difficult, they were working on the script right up until the night before the episode was first broadcast.The Margaritaville blender itself served as a metaphor for consumerism and the tendency of Americans to buy luxuries that they do not need. Stone said, ""We didn't want to make an episode where it was like, 'Oh, those Wall Street guys took our money.' It was one of those things where we all screwed up and nobody really knows what's going on, but it has something to do with buying shit like Margaritavilles."" The Margaritaville also serves as a metaphor for the housing bubble. Parker himself actually owns a Margaritaville, of which he said, ""It's pretty stupid because it really is just a blender"".


== Cultural references ==

The episode's title comes from the Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville blender featured in the episode, which serves as a metaphor for the housing bubble. ""Margaritaville"" is also the name of a popular 1977 song by Jimmy Buffett, who has been the butt of South Park humor in the past. In ""Margaritaville"", Kyle is portrayed as a Jesus-like savior who makes a tremendous sacrifice to save the economy. A dinner he has with his friends is portrayed as the Last Supper, the final meal Jesus had with his Twelve Apostles before his death. Cartman takes on the role of Judas Iscariot, the disciple who betrayed Jesus (in the Last Supper scene he even sits in the same position as Judas in da Vinci's painting), while some of the South Park residents form a council. Kyle uses a platinum American Express card to pay off the debts of all South Park residents.Cartman says he wants the soon-to-be-released Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars game for the handheld game console Nintendo DS. The game was released within a week of the original ""Margaritaville"" broadcast date. Representatives from game developer Rockstar Games told video game blog Kotaku they liked the reference, and did not know in advance it would be in the episode.


== Reception ==
Parker and Stone themselves were not entirely pleased with the final result of ""Margaritaville"". Although they liked the idea, they felt the main storyline involving the economy and the subplot involving Stan and the Margaritaville blender did not come together in the end as the duo originally hoped they would when they started writing the script. Parker said of the episode, ""I give the concept on this an A, and the execution like a C−."" In its original American broadcast, ""Margaritaville"" was watched by 2.77 million overall households, according to the Nielsen Media Research, making it the most-watched Comedy Central production of the week. The episode received generally positive reviews from television critics. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly said of the episode, ""The episode was the most back-handed endorsement imaginable of President Obama's economic bailout plan. Or the most withering dismantling of it. As usual, South Park had it both ways."" Tucker also said of Cartman's blaming the Jews for the recession, ""Among its many achievements, South Park has exposed anti-Semitism to such relentless ridicule over the years, it deserves some sort of humanitarian award.""Financial writer Roger Nusbaum said the episode was not only ""humorous"" but provided a decent analysis of the recession. He particularly praised Randy's inclusion of margaritas with the barest of necessities; Nusbaum said most people tend to take on absurd expenses that they fail to realize are unnecessary, even as they discuss the plight of the economy. Brad Trechak of HuffPostTV called ""Margaritaville"" a highlight of the season. Mike Fahey of Kotaku said the episode had ""a clever little plot"". Zac Bissonnette of BloggingStocks said of the episode, ""It isn't quite as trenchant as some of the other Wall Street satire that's been making the rounds, but it's definitely worth watching."" Carlos Delgado of If magazine said the episode included many excellent moments, including the headless chicken method of making economic decisions, but otherwise felt ""Margaritaville"" was not as strong as previous episodes like ""The Ring"". Delgado said, ""Maybe I'm too depressed about the current economic situation, who knows, but although 'Margaritaville' was well written and poignant, I wasn't bursting out in laughter every two minutes.""In 2016, the episode was highlighted in the academic journal Religions.The segment in which the bankteller says ""And... it's gone"" has become a popular internet meme.


== Emmy Award ==
Parker and Stone decided to submit ""Margaritaville"" for an Emmy Award because they had received a large amount of positive feedback about the episode from adults and older viewers. Since most Emmy voters are older, they decided ""Margaritaville"" stood the best chance of winning. Stone joked, ""If an Emmy voter were to watch this, they might think the show was smarter than it was, so they might be fooled into voting for us."" ""Margaritaville"" ultimately won the 2009 Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program for Programming Less Than One Hour. It competed against Robot Chicken, The Simpsons and American Dad! at the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards, which was held September 12, 2009.


== Home media ==
""Margaritaville"", along with the thirteen other episodes from South Park's thirteenth season, were released on a three-disc DVD set and two-disc Blu-ray set in the United States on March 16, 2010. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode, a collection of deleted scenes, and a special mini-feature Inside Xbox: A Behind-the-Scenes Tour of South Park Studios, which discussed the process behind animating the show with Inside Xbox host Major Nelson.

== Saint Mary's Parish Church ==
 

Għaxaq's main church is dedicated to the Assumption of Our Lady and it is known for its baroque architecture. The present church was consecrated on 2 May 1784, after around fifty years of hard work by the villagers, which gave a helping hand in building their religious shrine. One could find a large number of artistic and valuable items in this church which were made by renowned Maltese and foreign artists. Of these one could find a number of highly artistic statues which all seek great devotion in a way or another. The titular statue which depicts the Assumption in heaven of our Lady was carved in wood by Mariano Gerada in 1808. Another statue which could be found in this church is that of the Main Secondary Feast of Saint Joseph which was made by Fratelli Bertarelli of Milan in Italy in 1932 and is also carved in wood. Other statues are those of Our Lady of the Rosary carved in wood by Alessandro Farrugia, Our Lady of Fátima and a set of traditional eight statues depicting the passion of Jesus Christ. These were made throughout the years with statues of Maltese artists Peppi Vella, Carlo Darmanin and family Camilleri Cauchi, namely Alfred and Aaron Camilleri Cauchi. The statue of dead Christ known as Il-Monument was brought to Għaxaq from Rome in the 18th century. The paintings which decorate the church's ceiling were painted by Emvin Cremona during the 1960s while other works of art date back to the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries mostly painted by Maltese artists; Gio Nicola Buhagiar, Francesco Zahra, Rokku Buhagiar and Gianni Vella among others. Apart from the Titular feast of Saint Mary which is celebrated annually on 15 August, other feasts are celebrated along the year. These are; the commemoration of the Passion of Jesus Christ and his rise from dead- with the traditional Good Friday procession, which in Għaxaq is held on Palm Sunday evening, celebrated a Sunday before Easter, the Main Secondary feast of Saint Joseph celebrated on the first Sunday of June, Corpus Christi on the second Sunday of June and Our Lady of the Rosary on the second Sunday of October. These are all organised by their respective confraternities. On the night between 24 and 25 December, a solemn mass is held to celebrate Christmas.


== Band Clubs ==
Għaxaq is known for its two feasts which are celebrated on 15 August and the first Sunday of June. The Holy family seeks a great devotion in this village, in fact it is the only village in Malta which have its Titular and Main Secondary feast dedicated to Saint Mary and Saint Joseph respectively, which together with Jesus, they form the Holy Family. Throughout the years two Social and Musical Societies emerged in the village and they contribute for the external celebrations of their respective patron saint.


=== Saint Mary Band Club Ħal Għaxaq A.D 1873 ===
St. Mary's Band Club has a very interesting history. Back in time, precisely in 1808, this club was set up from simply a wine shop to the majestic band club present today.
The feast of St Mary has been and still is a popular feast among the Maltese people especially where the village church has as its Titular St. Mary. Traditionally St Mary is linked to the Santa Maria Convoy which brought much needed food supplies to the Maltese. This took place exactly on 15 August 1942, during the peak of the Second World War. Having its church dedicated to the Assumption of Mary since 1511, the village of Għaxaq in the south east of Malta is no exception.
Since 1808, the village is documented to have celebrated this feast, both the religious part and the secular part, with vigor and pomp.  The religious aspect was reflected in the fact that an artistic statue was made by a well known sculpture Mariano Gerada. This was financed by Gio Maria Farrugia (1763–1828) and cost 800 scudi. Of course an artistic plinth was also made. The Farrugia family tree is endorsed at St. Mary's Band Club. In those days they had their wine shop. They talked mostly about the feast, year in year out. One shop was called Ta’ Indri l-Mikk. People used to meet there and given the aspirations of the locals, this stop was the forerunner of the present band club. Indri himself, took it upon himself to organize the outside (secular) feast of St. Mary.  The square in front of the church was decorated with colourful bundings. The church’s façade was illuminated with hundreds of oil lamps. This was the work of the Gatt, Duca, Desira and Scicluna's families.
In 1873 the people named above explored the possibility of moving from this shop to much bigger premises. Agreement was reached on buying a big house in the square known as Ta’ Bukkettuwa. After initial work was completed the club came to be known as Circolo La Stella. 
It was at Ta' Petistina that the first general sitting was held and it was agreed that the first official committee members were to be drawn following a ballot. The first steering committee was elected and was made up of Felic Gatt, Joseph Grima, Joseph Scicluna and Geraldu Scicluna.  More members were added like Agius, Abdilla and Gravina. Later on, in 1935, a band was also formed under the name Santa Maria Band.
Many years passed since then and today the band club has a great number of members and followers. Today, the Band Club is also renowned for the organisation of the Ghaxaq Music Festival, a 2 to 5 day festival organised before the feast of Saint Mary in August. Since 2008, the Festival has featured renowned World Artists and Tribute Bands such as; Tracy Shields in a Tribute to Celine Dion(2008), Rhapsody UK in a Tribute to the legendary Queen(2009 and 2011), U2UK(2009), ABBA UK(2010), Gimme ABBA(2011), Sheyla Bonnick from the original BoneyM(2011) and the legendary group SMOKIE(2012). This festival actually started in 1998 as a Street Concert and since then it also featured a lot of Maltese groups and singers such as; Tribali, Wintermoods, Scream Daisy, Freddie Portelli, Joe Brown Band and renowned Maltese ""Għannejja"" among other well known local artists and Dj's such as; Carl Bee, Dj Ruby and Dj Armani.
The Club also possesses a lot of artistic street decorations, having a large number of statues and their pedestals dating back to more than 100 years ago. These together with new sets of drapes, chandeliers and other statues decorate the village during the first two weeks of August.
Fireworks also play an important part during the Maltese traditional feast. The Saint Mary Fireworks Factory consists of a number of voluntary professionals in the art of firework production. These people, have also achieved 1st place in a number of local and International Fireworks Festivals both for the aerial as well as the ground fireworks. The Saint Mary Fireworks Team was also invited to take part as International guests in The 2011 FireworksOne Festival at Foggia,San Severo, Italy. Moreover, after the huge success they achieved in 2011, the Ghaxaq Local Council also presented them with the ""Ġieħ Ħal Għaxaq"", a prestigious award given annually to people who work and achieve success for the village.
Thus, although a small village, the people of Ghaxaq have at heart the feast of St. Mary and this is reflected in their dedication shown during 3 whole weeks of religious and secular activities for St. Mary’s feast.


=== Saint Joseph Band Club ===
The Saint Joseph Band Club  was established in 1874 with the principal object of organising and enhancing the feast of St. Joseph in collaboration with the Confraternity of Saint Joseph, an older Catholic Church organisation dating back to around 1689. Since then, the Band Club has taken under its remit the external festivities while the Confraternity has concentrated on the liturgical celebrations. The Club used to participate also in the feast of the Assumption of St. Mary until the early 1950s, when this participation was discontinued.
The feast of Saint Joseph is presently celebrated annually on the first Sunday of June, though in past years the date was earlier in May.
The Band Club's biggest ever project is surely its premises.  During a project spanning from the early nineteen-eighties till the official opening in May 2000, the Club acquired both previously-rented and adjacent property, demolished the existing structures and rebuilt a unitary building.  The building is considered as a prime example of Maltese baroque-style architecture, and in certain aspects takes Maltese craftsmanship to new heights.  A visitor to the building should not fail to note the symmetrical curved staircase topped by a dome structure, the various relief sculpture adorning various walls, ceilings, cornices and pedestals and the first floor halls.
At first-floor level, there is also a niche with the older statue of Saint Joseph, which was replaced in 1933 with the present devotional statue retained in the Church for the devotion of the Catholic community.  The older statue has been restored this year 2010 and it transpired that the wooden statue was probably manufactured in Malta at around 1650.  This date is corroborated both by the style of the carving and by the evident aging of the wood.  The present Għaxaq church was built at around that same time.  The statue is therefore key proof to the longevity of the devotion to Saint Joseph and has also significant historical and artistic value, being in absolute terms the oldest existing devotional statue in Għaxaq and actually one of the oldest still in existence on the entire Maltese Islands.
The Band Club is also in possession of two other separate properties: a fireworks factory that is renowned for the quality of its festive fiery production; and a feast decorations factory, comprising a workshop and stores for the Baroque-style festive street decorations.  The fireworks factory won the Villa de Bilbao international fireworks festival edition of 2010 against world-renowned international opponents.The actual feast of Saint Joseph is celebrated throughout ten days.  While big crowds of people throng the streets of Għaxaq, the village puts on its best dress in green (the colour of the Saint Joseph clan) and is entirely decorated with the decorations manufactured or otherwise managed by the above-mentioned workshop.  The Club's own band and other guest bands play the typical Maltese band-marches to the general merry-making of the Josephite supporters, guests and tourists who are always welcome to join.  Street concerts are also held, many times attracting national attention.  Various fireworks displays are held throughout the week, culminating in the Saturday night show known as 'The Flames of Fire' and the Sunday evening 'kaxxa nfernali'.  The final celebration is the devotional procession of the statue of Saint Joseph through the village streets - a fitting conclusion for the Patron Saint.  This feast has over the years increased its popularity and has become a regular crowd-puller, putting Għaxaq in the top echelons of Maltese festivals.

== Carnival ==
Another annual event is the carnival celebration held in February.The carnival celebration is reported to have been around for roughly 150 years, and also features a children’s parade, an idea backed by the local council to encourage more children to take an interest in their local culture.

== History ==
Built in 1618, the Orthodox church dedicated to Saint Nicholas is the oldest religious object built in Vrlika. A bell tower was added and consecrated by hieromonk Vikentija (Stojisavljević) from Dragović monastery in 1801 and its current iconostas dates from the mid-19th century.Throughout the centuries, the church was the target multiple arson attempts during world wars and most recently, the Yugoslav Civil War. On May 28, 1972, the church was severely damaged in a fire set by Croatian nationalists during the Croatian Spring crisis, only to be restored two years later on May 26, 1974.  Between 1990–1991, explosives were planted around the church several times by Croatian nationalists.Starting in 2015, renovations were made to the church with new doors, windows and a new metal staircase leading up to the bell tower. A complete restoration of the church exterior facade was also included in the project which cost approximately one hundred thousand Euros raised by Vrlika's Serbian Orthodox faithful from all around the world.In August 2018, the Serbian Orthodox inhabitants of Vrlika along with many Vrlika Serbs from the diaspora, congregated in Vrlika to celebrate the 400 year anniversary of the church.

Super Raoul has been released in two editions. The first edition was released through a limited Mimicry pressing and has a cover with a photograph montage that refers to the band as ""Fishtank"". There is no copyright on the disc.
The second edition was independently released. The album cover features a cartoon by Garth Kauffman on the cover and refers to the band as ""Fishtank Ensemble"".
Besides purely aesthetic differences, there are significant differences between the sound quality of the releases. Though both of the CDs have the same tracks in the same order, the Mimicry pressing of Super Raoul is inferior to the quality of the independent pressing; notably so on the songs ""Hora di Bucharest/Hora de Fabrice"" and ""Suite Romaine"". On the Mimicry pressing, these songs ""skip"", then abruptly silence repeatedly. This is most likely due to an error in transferring the data of the tracks. On the second edition, these tracks do not have such problems. Though the first edition is technically inferior in quality, it is perhaps likely to become a collector's item.
Many consumers who have purchased the first edition CD from CD Baby have been sent a replacement CD along with a short note of apology.

He was the leader of the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD), a three-time candidate for president of the Dominican Republic and former Mayor of Santo Domingo. He is considered, along with Joaquín Balaguer and Juan Bosch, as one of the most prominent Dominican political figures of the 20th century.","José Francisco Peña Gómez (6 March 1937 – 10 May 1998) was a politician from the Dominican Republic. He was the leader of the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD), a three-time candidate for president of the Dominican Republic and former Mayor of Santo Domingo. He is considered, along with Joaquín Balaguer and Juan Bosch, as one of the most prominent Dominican political figures of the 20th century.


== Early life ==
Born to María Marcelin, a Haitian woman, and Oguís Vincent, a Haitian immigrant, on March 6, 1937 in Mao, Dominican Republic, Peña Gómez was adopted as an infant by Simón Pichardo and Andrea Rodríguez de Pichardo, a Dominican family, when his parents had to flee to Haiti (where they died) in order to save their lives as the Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo enacted the Parsley Massacre against Haitians that same year. In later years, Peña Gómez’ opponents would use his Haitian ancestry against him.
Peña Gómez received a BA-equivalent degree from the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo (UASD) in 1966 before going on to higher studies at the Sorbonne in Paris.


== The April Civil War and Exile ==
Since 1961, Peña Gómez became a supporter of Juan Bosch, then leader of the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD). Bosch won the presidential elections of 1962, the first democratic president in 32 years, but his government was ousted in a military coup on September 25, 1963. In 1965, Peña rose to political prominence as he went on Radio Santo Domingo and called for a popular insurrection against the military coup and a return of Bosch. U. S. President Lyndon Johnson ordered a military invasion to prevent what he feared was a possible communist movement within the country.


== Leadership of the P.R.D. ==
In December 1973, Bosch formed the Dominican Liberation Party (P.L.D.). Under Peña's leadership, the P.R.D. won the presidential election in 1978 (Antonio Guzmán) and 1982 (Salvador Jorge Blanco), and he himself was Mayor of Santo Domingo from 1982 to 1986. His period is mostly remembered for the creation of the Plaza Güibia (Güibia Plaza), on the seaside boulevard and plantation of ornamental trees in mayor Santo Domingo city avenues.
In 1990, Peña ran for the presidency, coming in third behind Balaguer of the Social Christian Reformist Party (PRSC) and Bosch of the PLD.
By 1994, the PRD was solidified and motivated, and Peña was once again the party's standard-bearer in the presidential election. Even by Dominican standards, the 1994 campaign was violent and dirty. Peña lost to Balaguer in an extremely tight election marred by numerous irregularities. A number of Peña supporters showed up to vote only to discover their names had vanished from the rolls. Peña called a general strike which was widely supported by his followers. After international protest, an investigation was mounted that raised grave concerns about the poll's legitimacy. The electoral board did not know the total number of registered voters, and the voting lists distributed at polling stations did not match those given to the parties. The investigation also revealed that about 200,000 people had been removed from the polls. After intense negotiations, Balaguer announced that he would leave office prematurely in 1996 after serving seven terms in power.
In the 1996 poll, Peña won the first round of voting but fell short of the majority needed. In the second round of voting, Leonel Fernández, a lawyer representing the PLD, won a narrow victory due to an alliance between the PLD with Balaguer's PRSC.


== Personal life ==
Peña Gómez married four times, the first time with Julia Idalia Guaba Martínez. The children are as follows: Lourdes Fátima, Luz del Alba “Luchy”, José Francisco “José Frank”, and Francisco Antonio “Tony” Peña Guaba.
His second marriage was to Ana Rosa Meléndez (former Director of the Museum of Modern Dominican Art); their child was María Rosa Peña Meléndez.
His fourth and last marriage was to Peggy Cabral, daughter of the Dominican writer Manuel del Cabral. Peña had nine children in total.


== Final years ==
Peña Gómez died on May 10, 1998 in Cambita Garabitos, San Cristóbal, 6 days before the mayoral elections of Santo Domingo, in which he was running.
Peña Gómez was one of the most popular leaders in recent political history in Dominican Republic, especially among the poor masses.
Being a key political figure until his death, the main Dominican Republic international airport was renamed from ""Aeropuerto Internacional Las Américas"" to ""Aeropuerto Internacional Las Américas José Francisco Peña Gómez"".


== Legacy ==
A metro station and an International Airport in Santo Domingo is named in honor of Peña Gómez.

The Court upheld the right to have an abortion, declaring unconstitutional the statute's requirement of prior written consent from a parent (in the case of a minor) or a spouse (in the case of a married woman).


== Background of the case ==


=== The District Court's ruling ===
The plaintiffs brought suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, seeking injunctive relief. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2281, the court convened a three-judge panel to try the case. The panel consisted of Eighth Circuit Judge William Hedgcock Webster, District Judge Harris Kenneth Wangelin, and Senior District Judge Roy Winfield Harper. The court held that Section 6(1) of the challenged act, which ""prescribe[d] the standard of care which a person performing an abortion must exercise for the protection of the fetus"" was unconstitutionally overbroad. It upheld the rest of the challenged act. Judge Webster concurred with the panel majority in finding 6(1) overboard and upholding ""the constitutional validity of Section 2(2)[1] (defining ""viability""), Section 3(2) (requiring the woman's written consent to an abortion), Section 10 (maintenance of records) and Section 11 (retention of records)."" He dissented from the majority opinion with respect to four other provisions: 3(3) (spousal consent requirement), 3(4) (parental consent requirement), 7 (termination of parental rights if child is born alive), and 9 (prohibition of saline amniocentesis method of abortion). Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, 392 F.Supp. 1362, 1365 (E.D. Missouri 1975).


== The Court's opinions ==


=== The majority opinion ===
The court struck down the provisions of the statute that required spousal and parental consent to obtain an abortion.  The court upheld the statute's recordkeeping requirement for abortion facilities and physicians that perform abortions.
In addressing the issue of spousal consent, the Court upheld the lower court's decision that just as the state could not regulate or proscribe abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy nor could the state ""delegate to a spouse veto power.""

== Setting ==
Gear Krieg is an alternate history take on World War II, where the technology curve is a little more steep than in our own reality. Technology, such as personal jet packs, rocket fighters, and walking tanks, are developed during the course of the war, sometimes massively changing events and famous battles.
From the game's rulebook: ""The world would indeed have been a different place had the Roaring Twenties not delivered the wonders promised by visionaries. Instead, war walkers now stride across the battlefield of Europe, huge supertanks thunder over North Africa, rocket fighters duel high above the Pacific, adventurers and superspies battle the Nazi forces in the shadows and scientists work feverishly in their laboratories to perfect the next doomsday weapon for their masters. Powered by advanced science, will the darkness of fascism spread across the world, or can brave men and women prevent it?""


== Rules ==
Gear Krieg is based on the Silhouette game engine, a streamlined set of rules that is already described in Heavy Gear, Dream Pod 9's other science fiction game. It can be played as either a role-playing game (RPG), a tactical wargame, or an hybrid integration of both.
Both the RPG and miniature games are built on the same basic rule mechanics. Silhouette is a realistic, simulationist system that defines characters in terms of ten base attributes (agility, knowledge, etc.), 5 derived attributes (health, etc.), and a variety of skills. Skill rolls make up the backbone of the system, which focuses on effect-based speed of play over grainy detail. The core mechanic involves rolling a number of 6-sided dice, taking the highest result and comparing it to a set threshold number. If the result is higher than the threshold the test is a success; if it is lower the test is a failure. The margin by which the test succeeded (Margin of Success, MoS) or failed (Margin of Failure, MoF) helps to determine the final outcome. Combat is handled by the same system, with characters taking penalty-inflicting wounds rather than depleting a set number of health points. As a result, the system can be lethal, especially on inexperienced characters. To keep the proper pulp high-action atmosphere, the game includes rules that allow players to twist the odds in their favor, in keeping with the conventions of the adventure genre.


== Publication history ==
Just as its support for Tribe 8 was starting to fade, Dream Pod 9 came out with their fourth RPG, Gear Krieg (2001), an alternate-history role-playing game set during World War II where technology was more advanced and thus the game featured technological anachronisms such as walking tanks. Like the company's earlier game Heavy Gear, Gear Krieg could be played either as a role-playing game or a tactical one.  The Silhouette CORE Rulebook (2003) offered a new standalone version of Silhouette that turned it into a generic system and also contained rules for converting d20 to Silhouette. The 'SilCORE' book – as it was called – was immediately followed by the Mecha Companion (2003), which offered d20 stats for all the mecha from Heavy Gear, Jovian Chronicles and Gear Krieg using Guardians of Order's d20 Mecha (2003) mech description rules.  The creation of the SilCORE book also allowed Dream Pod 9 to rerelease old games in dual d20 and Silhouette form, and the next year thus saw the release of Jovian Chronicles second edition (2003), Gear Krieg second edition (2003), Heavy Gear third edition (2003), Tribe 8 second edition (2004) and the brand new CORE Command (2003).: 273

== From the Prologue to the movie ==
When Germany stretched greedy hands towards the Middle East in the war or 1914–1918, a great cavalry force came into being.
They were the men from Australia and New Zealand – The ANZACS – the ""Mad Bushmen"" – the men from ""Downunder"". Call them what you will – their glories can never grow dim.
They met the Germanised Army in the burning desert of Sinai.
They fought and suffered to emerge triumphant – the greatest cavalry force of modern times.
To these dauntless riders and their gallant horses this story is dedicated. To them with pride, their own sons are saying today -
""The torch you threw to us, we caught and now our hands will hold it high. Its glorious light will never die!""


== Plot ==
In 1916 Jerusalem, German troops led by Captain Von Schiller arrest French wine seller Paul Rouget for spying and hang him. His daughter Juliet goes into hiding dressed as a boy and starts spying on the Germans.
Three members of the Australian Lighthorse, Red, Larry and Jim, are enjoying themselves (including a game of two-up) on leave in Cairo, when called to fight the Turks. They take part in several battles including the march to Ogratina and the Battle of Romani. Red is separated from the others after one battle and has his life saved by Juliet, who he thinks is an Arab boy.
Red is reunited with his friends and they arrive at an Arab village. He meets Juliet and realises she was the boy who saved his life. They begin a romance.
The Battle of Gaza takes place; Jim and Larry are mortally wounded and Red is captured. He is sent to Beersheba to work as slave labour and discovers the town is wired with explosives. Juliet rescues him and they spend the night together in a hut.

=== Development ===
Chauvel was the nephew of Sir Harry Chauvel, commander of the Australian Light Horse during the Sinai and Palestine campaign and had long planned a film based on the exploits of the Light Horse. It was originally to be titled Thunder Over the Desert.To raise funds for a movie, Chauvel shot a £5,000 ""teaser"" sequence, consisting of a cavalry charge based around the Battle of Beersheba. The cost for this was paid for by Herc McIntyre, managing director of Universal Pictures in Australia who was a long-time friend and associate of Chauvel's. Filming of this sequence took place on 1 February 1938 on the Cronulla sand dunes using a cavalry division of the Australian Light Horse, which had been performing in the New South Wales sesquicentenary celebrations.The charge was filmed by a four-camera unit, composed of Frank Hurley, Tasman Higgins, Bert Nicholas and John Heyer. A cavalryman was injured during the shoot.In 1939 Chauvel and McIntyre formed Famous Films Ltd to make the movie. Chauvel used the footage to raise the budget, which was originally announced at £25,000. £5,000 was provided by McIntyre and £10,000 from Hoyts. The New South Wales government agreed to guarantee a bank overdraft of £15,000 although they did not invest directly in the movie.


=== Casting ===
The movie marked the first lead role for Grant Taylor, who rose to prominence in Dad Rudd, MP (1940). It was the first sizeable role for Chips Rafferty, who had been cast after a screen test. Chauvel described him as ""a cross between Slim Summerville and Jame Stewart, and has a variety of droll yet natural humour."" Joe Valli reprised his Scottish soldier from Pat Hanna's Digger Shows.
Taylor was paid £15 a week, Rafferty £10 a week.Betty Bryant was a discovery of Elsa Chauvel's. She beat out Pat Firman for the role.


=== Shooting ===
Shooting began in May 1940. Interiors were shot in the Cinesound studios at Bondi which Chauvel leased from Cinesound Productions for a three-month period. A second unit was used to build a desert village at Cronulla. The battle scenes were shot there in July and August, using the 1st Light Horse (Machine Gun) Regiment and the 30th Battalion.


== Censorship ==
After the film's preview, the Commonwealth film censor, Creswell O'Reilly, requested three major cuts – display of the dancing girls in a cabaret, the love scene between Red and Juliette in a hut, and alleged cruelty to horses during the final charge. This threatened Chauvel's ability to export the film and screen it in Victoria. Eventually the Minister for Customs, Eric Harrison, overruled the decision and allowed the movie to be screened uncut. The movie was also passed uncut in Victoria.


== Release ==


=== Critical ===
Reviews were overwhelmingly positive. The critic from The Sydney Morning Herald claimed that ""there have been some good Australian films before this one, but Forty Thousand Horsemen has every right to be regarded as the first really great Australian picture.""Filmink magazine later wrote ""the film was Taylor's. There had been other notable leading men in Australian films – Snowy Baker, Errol Flynn – but it was really Taylor who was the first tough Aussie star type, that would be so exemplified by Rod Taylor, Jack Thompson, Mel Gibson and Bryan Brown.""


=== Box office ===
It was a massive success at the box office, grossing £10,000 within its first three weeks of release, enabling Famous Features Ltd to buy out the interest of the New South Wales government for £15,000. The film was seen by 287,000 in Sydney alone during a ten-week run on first release.Female lead Betty Bryant was sent to Singapore for the film's premiere in June 1941. While there she met MGM executive Maurice Silverstein, who she would later marry, leading to her retirement from acting.


=== Foreign release ===
The movie was released in the US by Sherman S. Krellberg for Monogram Pictures and was very well received.""Yippee for brawling, boisterous entertainment"", wrote the critic for The New York Times, praising Betty Bryant (""whatever it is that leaps across the celluloid barrier, she has"") although claiming the story was ""foolish"". The Los Angeles Times said the film was ""conventional in formula but enlivened by stirring battle scenes – and new faces."" ""Contains all the color and lusty vigor of the men themselves"" said The Washington Post.It earned over £40,000 in the UK.In 1954 the film was cut down to 50 minutes for screening on US television.

He played club football with Eintracht Frankfurt and its predecessor clubs.


== Career ==
Goalkeeper Gmelin started his first team career in 1907 at Frankfurter FC Victoria 1899. Four years later Victoria merged with fellow Frankfurt club Frankfurter Kickers to form Frankfurter FV (Kickers-Victoria). Another nine years later another club merger formed Eintracht Frankfurt. In 1911–12 Gmelin's team only lost 2 of 23 matches, securing the Nordkreis championship and the qualification for the South German championship. In encounters with SpVgg Fürth, Karlsruher FV and Phönix Mannheim Frankfurter FC Victoria 1899 could only achieve two draws. In 1912–13 Victoria won the Nordkreis title once more and participated in another South German championship round where the Frankfurt club closely missed out the first spot that would have allowed playing the 1913 German championship.
In the next season Gmelin's Victoria won the 3rd Nordkreis league in a row and another runners-up finish in the South German round.
After the outbreak of World War I football fixtures were stopped. After the war many former football players met to revive competitive football. In 1920 and 1921 Gmelin won the Nordmain championship with Eintracht before hanging up his boots.
Wilhelm Gmelin was honorary captain at Eintracht Frankfurt.

== Poker ==
Reinkemeier began playing poker in 2006 and started playing live tournaments in 2007 with small cashes.
At the 2009 EPT Barcelona Main Event, Reinkemeier was accused of angle shooting professional poker player Roland De Wolfe after calling De Wolfe's river bet. The community cards in order were A♥ 10♣ 7♣ 9♥ 4♥, while Reinkemeier and De Wolfe were the only players remaining in the hand. As the last player to have either bet or raised during the final round of betting, De Wolfe was expected to reveal his hand first. After a brief discussion, De Wolfe intentionally flashed K♣ face up, then placed the same card face down without revealing his second hole card, presumably to suggest his hesitancy to showing a bluff. With cards in hand, De Wolfe appears to fold by motioning both hole cards towards the muck, and temporarily placing both hole cards under the pile of discarded cards. As De Wolfe appeared to have surrendered the pot, Reinkemeier immediately revealed Q♣ 6♣ which failed to make a club flush and finished with High Card Queen. By this point in time, the dealer had revealed De Wolfe’s hole cards as K♣ 8♦, or High Card King which would have been the winning hand. Recognizing this, De Wolfe attempted to retrieve his cards claiming his hand was not mucked. A tournament director was called to the table to settle the growing dispute, and ruled that De Wolfe had indeed folded awarding the pot to Reinkemeier.In 2010, Reinkemeier won the EPT €25,000 High Roller event for €965,000. Reinkemeier finished 5th in the 2014 WSOP $1,000,000 Big One for One Drop event, earning $2,053,334.Reinkemeier plays online under the nickname PokerNoob999. He won 29 May 2011 Sunday Millions on PokerStars for $135,053. As of 2016, Reinkemeier's live tournament winnings exceed $10,500,000 putting him 3rd on the German all time money list behind Fedor Holz and Ole Schemion.

There is a stylistic echo in Osama featured in Afghan films by the Iranian Makhmalbaf dynasty. Barmak directed Osama with significant funding and assistance from Mohsen Makhmalbaf. The Iranian director invested in the film, lending Barmak his Arriflex camera and encouraging him to send the movie to international festivals, which eventually generated further funding from Japanese and Irish producers.

Pennington is the only current member of the band remaining from its early days.


== Career ==


=== Early years ===
The origins of Exile were with a high school band in Richmond, Kentucky, called the Fascinations, which featured singer Jimmy Stokley. In 1963, the Fascinations merged with another local band and became Jimmy Stokley and the Exiles, with singer/guitarist J.P. Pennington, then age 14, joining a short time later. They toured regionally with the Dick Clark Caravan of Stars in 1965. Their name was later shortened to The Exiles, apparently to show support for Cuban refugees.After high school, the band moved to Lexington, Kentucky, and recorded several singles for small labels between 1968 and 1973. In 1973 the name was shortened again to Exile, with Stokley on lead vocals, Pennington on vocals and guitar, Buzz Cornelison on keyboards, Kenny Weir on bass, and Bobby Johns on drums. This version of the band released a self-titled album on Wooden Nickel Records in 1973. They toured regionally for the next several years and had a minor pop hit with ""Try It On"" in 1977.


=== Late 1970s pop success ===
In 1978, Exile consisted of Stokley, Pennington, and Cornelison, plus second keyboardist Marlon Hargis, bassist Sonny LeMaire, and drummer Steve Goetzman. This lineup signed with Warner Brothers and released the album Mixed Emotions. The disco-influenced single ""Kiss You All Over"", written by the album's producer Mike Chapman and his songwriting partner Nicky Chinn, topped the American singles chart for four weeks and also reached the top ten in a dozen European countries. The song attracted some controversy for its risqué lyrics, while Stokley gained media attention as a flamboyant and charismatic frontman.The success of ""Kiss You All Over"" resulted in invitations for Exile to tour with Heart, Aerosmith, Fleetwood Mac, and other leading rock acts of the period. The follow-up album All There Is yielded the minor hit single ""The Part of Me That Needs You Most"", which reached the top ten in South Africa and New Zealand in 1979.


=== Transition to country music ===
Jimmy Stokley left the band in 1980 and was replaced by Les Taylor prior to recording sessions for the band's next album, Don't Leave Me this Way. Stokley died at age 41 on August 13, 1985 due to complications from hepatitis, and was later inducted into the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame with a speech by J.P. Pennington. Another longtime member, keyboardist Buzz Cornelison, also departed in the early 1980s. Meanwhile, in 1981, the band released their final album under the Warner Brothers label, Heart and Soul, featuring their original recording of the Chapman/Chinn-penned title track, which would become a big hit for Huey Lewis and the News several years later.  Exile's version was released as a single but failed to crack the Hot 100.
At this point, under the leadership of Pennington, Exile was revamped as a country band with a southern rock flavor. This version of the band signed with Epic Records in 1983 and had a top 40 country single with their first Epic release, ""High Cost of Leaving"". Some of their songs were covered by other country artists, including Janie Fricke and Alabama, the latter of whom would turn Exile's ""The Closer You Get"" (from their 1980 album Don't Leave Me This Way) into a #1 Country & Western single in 1983.  Starting in 1983, Exile had three consecutive top ten albums on the Billboard Country Albums chart (Exile, Kentucky Hearts, and Hang On to Your Heart, with the second of those reaching number one), and from 1983 to 1987 ten out of eleven singles reached number one on the Billboard Country Singles chart, making them one of the biggest country artists of the decade. They also received thirteen award nominations from the Academy of Country Music and the Country Music Association.Pennington and Taylor left the band in 1990, leaving it with no remaining members from its rock period. A new lineup featuring singer/guitarist Paul Martin signed with Arista Records and scored some more country hit singles, but they were dropped by Arista after the 1991 album Justice and disbanded in 1993. Twenty-one former members gathered for a farewell concert at the Grand Ole Opry.


=== Reformation ===
After leaving Exile in 1990, J.P. Pennington and Les Taylor both signed solo deals and achieved minor hit singles on the U.S. country charts. Pennington and Taylor performed together on stage in 1995 and decided to resurrect the Exile name. The new version of the band, led by Pennington and Taylor with a shifting cast of sidemen, continued to tour the nostalgia circuit. Since the 1990s the group has released several live albums, plus the new album Wrapped Up in Your Arms for Christmas in 2016.

== Origins ==


=== First proposals ===
First thoughts of a railway connecting Plymouth to Exeter were discussed from 1826, but the first definite proposal came when a meeting of potential promoters in 1840 resolved to build a direct route between the cities. They chose the direct route over two suggested longer routes, which were similar to the Teignmouth and Okehampton routes that were actually built later. Their preferred line was to be 37 miles (60 km) long, climbing to 1,190 feet (363 m) and would pass through very sparsely inhabited terrain; there were to be three rope-worked inclines and two long tunnels, and the construction cost was to be £770,781. This ambitious scheme was presented to Parliament as a Bill on 29 February 1840, but got no further there. Its supporters continued to argue in its favour, but the more practical scheme via Newton soon gained favour.The failure of this scheme did not suppress the enthusiasm in Plymouth for a railway, and this was heightened as the Bristol and Exeter Railway (B&ER) was constructing its broad gauge line. The Great Western Railway (GWR) and the B&ER were working in close harmony, and were known as the Associated Companies, forming a powerful broad gauge interest in railways. Supporters of what soon became the Plymouth, Devonport and Exeter Railway Company saw that financial support might be available from the Associated Companies, and so it proved, subject to substantial capital (£500,000) being raised locally as well, and that any chosen alignment in Plymouth would be suitable for later extension into Cornwall.
The choice of terminal in Plymouth was a fine point, for the ""Three Towns"" of Plymouth, Devonport and Stonehouse were independent and fiercely jealous of one another. With Isambard Kingdom Brunel now advising the promoters, a terminal at a neutral location at Eldad was selected. Located away from the centre of any of the Three Towns, it was mocked as being ""No Place""; a public house of that name at 353 North Road West on Eldad Hill was extant until recently, and Gregory speculates that it was built in anticipation of the South Devon's Eldad terminus.A prospectus was issued proposing the line, which with some detail changes, was similar to that actually operating today; the B&ER station at Exeter (St Davids) would be used, and the western terminal would be Eldad, with a branch to the harbour at Millbay. The company's name was changed to the South Devon Railway and a Parliamentary Bill was submitted in the 1844 session; with little opposition, it obtained its authorising Act on 4 July 1844. Share capital was to be £1,100,000 and the Associated Companies agree to subscribe, in the sums of:

Great Western Railway: £150,000
Bristol and Exeter Railway: £200,000
Bristol and Gloucester Railway: £50,000.


=== The atmospheric system adopted ===
Although the route was to follow the coast from Exeter to Newton (later called Newton Abbot), from there to Plymouth it would need to run over difficult hilly terrain, and gradients and curvature were challenging. Brunel had planned the route as a double-track locomotive railway, and as late as May 1844 he stated, in reference to the atmospheric system, ""I have not been called upon to recommend it or not"".However Brunel was concerned about the efficiency of available steam locomotives, and he had been interested in the 1840 demonstration of the atmospheric system at Wormwood Scrubs. The system is fully described in the article Atmospheric railway and in the technical section below. Briefly, it involves a pipe laid between the running rails, and stationary steam engines located at intervals of a few miles along the line; they exhaust air from the pipe, forming a partial vacuum. A piston carriage is placed at the head of each train, and it carries a piston which travels in the tube. The tube is slotted at the top to enable the piston bracket to pass, and a continuous leather seal prevents unwanted admission of air. With a partial vacuum in the pipe ahead of the piston, the pressure of the atmosphere behind it drives it forward, drawing the train. The leather seal is opened by rollers immediately ahead of the bracket carrying the piston, and closed immediately behind it.Jacob and Joseph Samuda had taken out a patent for the use of the atmospheric system on railways and operated the Wormwood Scrubbs demonstration; and from August 1843 trial runs had operated on the Dalkey Atmospheric Railway. The system appeared to be a solution to the difficulties: greater traction was possible, not relying on steel wheel adhesion, and avoiding the necessity to carry the weight of a locomotive and its fuel over the steep gradients. It was asserted that only a single line (instead of double track) would be needed to work the traffic by the atmospheric system, and that steeper gradients and sharper curves were feasible compared with locomotive operation, saving construction costs. In fact the capital outlay would be reduced by £67,000, allowing for the cost of construction of the pumping stations, and annual operating costs would be £8,000 cheaper.The system was considered at a Board meeting on 5 August 1844, and a few days later some of the directors visited Dalkey to assess the system in operation there. On 19 August the Board resolved to adopt the system. Gregory records that:
""The Chairman [Thomas Gill] admitted that at first he thought it unwise to use it, believing that it was unsuited to the particular circumstances of this neighbourhood, but after witnessing what he did on the Dublin & Dalkey Railway his prejudices were entirely removed.""The Directors' decision was put to the first Shareholders' meeting on 28 August 1844. A shareholder pointed out that the Dalkey line was less than 2 miles (3 km) in length whereas the South Devon was 50 miles; ""Brunel replied that this had been carefully considered and had they not been satisfied that it could be applied as well to 50 miles (80 km) as to 1+3⁄4 miles (2.8 km) the Directors would not have recommended it.""Questions were raised about crossing trains (i.e. passing opposing trains on the single line at crossing points) and speed; ""Brunel, dealing with the first point, replied that it would cause no problem, and the Chairman added that while 45 miles per hour (72 km/h) was the ordinary rate of travelling on the Dalkey line, he did not doubt that much higher speeds would be possible over the longer stretches of this line.""The atmospheric system was adopted by the meeting without opposition.Brunel had emphasised the lower capital and working costs of the system, the latter being £8,000 per annum cheaper, he said, than locomotive operation.Daniel Gooch, Brunel's locomotive engineer, said, ""I could not understand how Mr. Brunel could be so misled. He had so much faith in his being able to improve it that he shut his eyes to the consequences of failure.""Brunel said, ""I have no hesitation in taking on myself the full and entire responsibility for recommending the adoption of the atmospheric system in the South Devon Railway, and of recommending as a consequence that the line and works should be constructed for a single line only.""And in evidence to the Select Committee on 4 April 1845, when asked about the ability of the system to bring trains over the steep gradients west of Newton, ""I propose to have different size pipes, or possibly to have double pipes.""


== Construction begins ==
Authority having been given and the atmospheric system endorsed, construction was soon started: the line would be a broad gauge single track. Brick arch underbridges were reduced by one ring; overbridges were reduced in headroom by 18 inches (457 mm), and the rails were to be 50 lb/yd (24.8 kg/m) instead of the planned 70 (34.7 kg/m).
These were still early days for contracting large construction projects, and probably for this reason the length from Exeter to Newton was first to be started. At something less than half the full length of the line, and generally close to sea level, this was certainly where the easier engineering lay; nonetheless some engineering challenges presented themselves: chief among these was forming a line at the foot of the steep cliffs around Teignmouth. This alone involved a vast rock cutting operation by blasting, as well as six tunnels and two ""covered ways"", and extensive sea wall protection. In addition an eight-span timber bridge over the River Exe immediately south of St Davids station, and a 62 arch viaduct at St Thomas were required.


=== First opening—using locomotives ===
By March 1846 the line between Exeter and Teignmouth was substantially complete except for the laying of the pipe for the atmospheric traction. In order to generate some income the directors decided to open this section using locomotives. Two 2-2-2 locomotives were hired in from the GWR at a hire charge of 1s 4d per train mile; the locomotives were named Exe and Teign. The passenger service started on the Saturday of Whitsun weekend, 30 May 1846, and huge numbers of people travelled. On Whit Monday 1500 passengers were conveyed in the morning train, in 21 carriages. Intermediate stations were at St Thomas, Starcross and Dawlish.
There had been delay in extending to Newton However a test train was able to run there on 22 December 1846 and on 31 December 1846 the passenger service to Newton started; the first train was hauled by the Sun Class locomotive Antelope. The normal service was six trains each way daily, with three on Sundays, all locomotive hauled: the atmospheric pipes were still unavailable.


=== The atmospheric system in use ===
The dates of the first running are inconsistent between commentators, but it is possible to discern the probable sequence.
On 25 February 1847 the first piston carriage was delivered at Exeter and at 6 pm that day it was taken as far as Turf to clear dirt and water out of the pipe.After this there were trips to Turf almost every day.Sekon records that, ""The first experiment of the atmospheric system on the South Devon line was made on 26th February 1847, when a train of two carriages went from Exeter to Turf and back, upon which occasion Mr Brunel said everything gave him full satisfaction.""After several months the first revenue earning train ran on the system:

On 18th August a goods train of eleven trucks, weighing 120 long tons (122 t; 134 short tons), travelled the 8+1⁄4 miles (13.3 km), Exeter to Starcross, in 15 minutes. On 8th September 1847, besides the usual service of trains hauled by locomotives, four extra ones commenced running, these being propelled by the atmospheric system. This was the first public use of the system on the South Devon Railway. Although the line was opened as far as Newton Abbot, between that station and Teignmouth locomotives were employed, but the piston carriage on the down train went on to  Newton, where it was taken off with the superfluous carriages and placed on a convenient line to be attached to the up train when required, so that, on arriving at Teignmouth, where the locomotive was removed, the piston carriage started the train when the signal was given.
Later writers assert different dates for these key events. Gregory, writing in 1982 says that the experimental first run to Turf was on 25 February 1847; and he says that it was on ""16th August that the first atmospheric train reached [Teignmouth]"". ""Early in September a daily goods train was regularly transferred to atmospheric working and the great day when the public could sample it for the first time [i.e. the start of atmospheric passenger train operation] was Monday 13th September [1847]."" ""On 17th December ... some service trains were worked for the first time by this method as far as Newton ... and on 23rd February [1848] the changeover [to full atmospheric operation] was complete.""The atmospheric system was first used for revenue earning trains early in September 1847 for goods trains, and the first atmospheric passenger train ran on 13 September 1847, between Exeter and Teignmouth. Two daily return trips now operated on the system, and the train service was progressively transferred to atmospheric; on 23 February 1848 the entire train service was operated on the atmospheric system.The trains ran well, and the absence of noise and smoke from locomotives was appreciated. In the period from the start of atmospheric operation until 18 January 1848, 884 trains were run, of which 790 had run to time or early; only 10 trains had lost more than ten minutes on the run. However 18 January was a day of severe frost, and the valve was prevented from making a good seal; no trains ran until the afternoon.Testing continued, and it was found that a train of 28 long tons (28.4 t; 31.4 short tons) ran at an average speed of 64 mph (103 km/h) over a three miles (4.8 km) section; however with a 100-long-ton (102 t; 112-short-ton) train, a maximum of only 35 mph (56 km/h) was attained.In August 1847 it emerged that Brunel had not yet ordered the engine house machinery for the line beyond Newton. He had originally specified a 13-inch (330 mm) diameter tube and 41+1⁄2 hp (30.9 kW) engines. Concerned about the tractive capacity, Brunel had substituted a 15-inch (380 mm) tube, and ""the machinery was clearly being heavily taxed even on the level section for all but the lightest trains."" He had decided to use a 22-inch (560 mm) pipe over the steep gradients west of Newton, and desired to accumulate as much experience as possible before committing himself. He later specified 68 hp (51 kW) engines.
Atmospheric working was extended to Newton on 10 January 1848.Operating costs were substantially higher than promised; this was particularly the case for fuel for the stationary engines, and daily attention to the tubes and the sealing flap. Despite buoyant income, operating costs had risen to 110% of income; the cost of the atmospheric section was 3s 1½d per mile compared with 2s 6d on the locomotive hauled sections. In the six months to 30 June 1848 the company made a net loss of £2,487.


=== Technical details of the atmospheric system ===

The atmospheric pipe was laid in the centre of the track. In cross-section it was not quite a complete circle, and a continuous slot was formed in the top to pass the bracket of the piston.
On 21 October 1844 a specification for the atmospheric pipes was published: they were to be of 13 inches (330 mm) internal diameter, and

they must be perfectly straight, and their inside diameters smooth and cylindrical. Two gauges will be furnished; one 12+7⁄8 inches [327 mm] diameter, and one 13+1⁄16 inches [332 mm] diameter: the smaller one must pass every pipe, and the pipes will be rejected as too large, if the larger one passes.
A 13-inch (330 mm) pipe was to be used between Exeter and Newton, with 15 inches (381 mm) generally being specified west of there, but 22 inches (559 mm) on the inclines. Brunel proposed an expanding piston so that trains could run through. In the summer of 1845 George Hennet had supplied 685 long tons (696 t; 767 short tons) of 15-inch (381 mm) pipe (for 3 miles or 4.8 kilometres) but Brunel decided that 13 inches (330 mm) was inadequate, and that 15 inches (381 mm) should be the minimum.
The slot was sealed by a longitudinal leather valve, that was lifted by rollers on the piston carriage as it passed, to let the piston bracket pass. Samuda was contracted to supply this.
The London and Croydon Railway system employed a metal weather cover over the leather valve, but this was not used on the SDR line.
The stationary steam engines were 40 hp (30 kW) vertical engines operating in pairs.  12 hp (8.9 kW) auxiliary engines were provided at each engine house for water pumping and other purposes. The engine houses were located at intervals of about 3 miles (4.8 km), and had a chimney in an Italianate style. The first four to Starcross were built in red sandstone, and later houses in grey limestone. Pumping was intended to create a vacuum of 15 inches (381 mm) of mercury, but leakage of the valve forced a higher degree of vacuum, to 20 inches (508 mm), to be created at the pump to create adequate vacuum at the remote end of the pipe section.
The piston carriage appears to have been a covered van. The piston was suspended from a bracket under the piston carriage, on a 20-foot (6.1 m) long beam, with a counterweight for balance. It was capable of being raised and lowered, so that at station areas it could be lifted clear. It was not possible to run the tube through pointwork. At some stations an 8-inch (203 mm) auxiliary pipe was provided at the lineside, from which the train could be towed by rope, but in many cases it is likely that horses were used for shunting and marshalling, and human power to move individual vehicles.
At the end of pipe sections there was a metal closure valve to maintain vacuum as the train approached. An automatic release mechanism used the air pressure ahead of the piston after it had passed the main pipe to the engine house, to open the valve. Where engine houses were located between stations, Kay states that the piston carriage passed from one pipe section to the next at full speed. It is not clear how the closure valve on the forward pipe was opened.
Brunel developed a system for use at level crossings. A metal flap lay across the pipe so that wheeled vehicles could cross, but as the pipe was exhausted a piston caused the flap to rise clear of the piston bracket.
Pumping to evacuate the pipe started between 5 and 8 minutes before the time a train was expected to enter the pipe section. For a long period there was no electric telegraph communication, so that the pumping had to start before the scheduled entry time; in the event of late running this meant wasted pumping. (The telegraph was commissioned on 2 August 1847; Brunel had inexplicably delayed its installation, and even now did not allow its use at night.)
It was possible to connect two section of pipe and for one engine house to exhaust both sections. This could be done in the event that an engine was temporarily inoperable.


=== Serious doubts—and abandonment ===
Throughout the early stages of the company's existence, there had been doubters about the atmospheric system; and these people were often vociferous when some setback or failure was reported. The alarming news was revived that on 4 May 1847 the London and Croydon Railway had decided to abandon the atmospheric system on their line, due to insuperable technical problems.Scepticism took effective form at the shareholders' meeting of August 1847. Promoted by a deputation the previous day led by George Hudson, the doubts resulted in a resolution to delay expenditure west of Totnes until after the next meeting. In fact at that meeting in February 1848 Brunel was evasive about the experience with the system, and on 28 March 1848 the Board instructed him to suspend work on the engines west of Totnes, and on 20 June they told him to dispose of those engines when complete.
Gradually through the summer the opinions of the Board members, and ultimately of Brunel, shifted against the atmospheric system. At a Board meeting on 28–29 August, Brunel suggests that Samuda (who still had contractual obligations to ensure effective operation of the system) might be unable to put matters right, and by the end of the second day the Board had decided to terminate the affair. The shareholders' meeting took place on 29 August 1848 and it now seemed that everyone was against the atmospheric, and a stormy meeting approved the suspension of the use of the system unanimously.
In fact the decision was to suspend until Samuda put the system into working order, but it was obvious he was not in a position to do so, and the last atmospheric train was an up goods arriving at Exeter at 12:30 in the small hours of Sunday 10 September 1848.The atmospheric system was at an end on the South Devon. The atmospheric engine houses were shut up and never worked again. £433,991 had been spent on equipment for the system; the company had no locomotives and could not afford to purchase any; it was building a single line, relying on the atmospheric system to obviate double track; and it had to proceed with the construction to Torquay and Plymouth.


== Completion to Plymouth ==


=== Construction from Newton to Laira ===
The line was opened from Newton to Totnes for passengers on 20 July 1847, and for goods trains on 6 December 1847. The atmospheric system was still in operation as far as Newton, and locomotive haulage was used beyond. Brunel pressed ahead with the section from Totnes to Plymouth, and this included more engineering structures than the previous sections. A trial run to a temporary station known as Laira (at Laira Green on the outskirts of Plymouth) was made on 27 April 1848 and the Board of Trade Inspector, Captain Symons, visited on 29 April. Approval having been obtained, the line opened on 5 May 1848. Goods traffic was not carried until 13 September 1848.Laira was some considerable distance short of Plymouth. The Plymouth and Dartmoor Railway (P&DR) crossed the path of the SDR there and ran on alongside the River Plym to wharves near Laira Bridge. It was a primitive horse-drawn tramway used for bringing granite down to the riverside from near Princetown, although its traffic volumes had declined very considerably. The SDR had obtained Parliamentary authority to purchase this section of the P&DR, subject to agreeing terms with the owners, but the negotiations were frustratingly slow.
The SDR started to lay their new main line across the course of the P&DR at Laira without agreement, and the P&DR owners responded by depositing large blocks of granite there, blocking the SDR.The Laira station was immediately on the Exeter side of the Laira crossing, at the turnpike bridge.
The only intermediate station was at Wrangaton (later renamed Kingsbridge Road), but additional stations at Brent, Ivybridge and Plympton were opened soon afterwards, and Cornwood was provided with a station in 1852. Double track was laid on Rattery Bank, and from Hemerdon to Laira Green.


=== Laira Green to Plymouth and Devonport ===
The differences with the proprietors of the P&DR were settled, and opening could take place to Plymouth. The original Eldad terminus had been omitted by Act of 1846, and a terminus in Plymouth at Millbay was adopted instead. There was intense rivalry between the Three Towns of Plymouth, Devonport and East Stonehouse at that time, and sensitivities were inflamed by the change. In an attempt to mollify opinion in Devonport, a branch to New Passage (on the Tamar) was now proposed, with a station in Devonport near Albert Road. The branch was built as far as the Devonport station with the junction there formed, but not extended to New Passage. The Devonport branch was transferred to the Cornwall Railway by the powers of an Act in the 1847 session, and it later formed the eastern part of its main line.
The public opening of the extension to ""Plymouth"" (the station later named Millbay) took place on 2 April 1849. Goods traffic started on 1 May 1849.


== Branches built by the South Devon company and its allies ==


=== Torquay and the Kingswear branch ===
The company had determined to build a branch to Torquay, and in 1846 it obtained Parliamentary powers to construct as far as ""a certain field in the Parish of Tormoham, which was as near as the House of Lords would allow them to get to Torquay"". That line was opened from Newton (Abbot) to a Torquay station on 18 December 1848. Powers for an extension to a more central Torquay location and to Brixham were secured in the SDR Act of 1847. However this was not proceeded with and in fact the extension was made by the independent Dartmouth and Torbay Railway, under powers obtained in 1857.
It opened from the SDR Torquay station as far as Paignton on 2 August 1859, with a station at Torquay. The SDR Torquay station was renamed Torre on the same day, and the SDR worked the new line. The short section incorporated an exceptional number of engineering structures; at Newton the branch ran alongside the main line for a mile to Aller. The line was further extended to Brixham Road (later renamed Churston) on 14 March 1861. Both the openings were for passengers only, goods traffic starting between Torre and Brixham Road on 1 April 1861.
At this stage the D&TR contemplated crossing the River Dart at Greenway so as to reach Dartmouth itself, but this failed due to opposition by a landowner. After some delay the company completed its line from Brixham Road to Kingswear on 16 August 1864, and a ferry was instituted by the company, connecting Dartmouth to the Kingswear station. Goods traffic did not start operating until 2 April 1866.
The SDR worked the entire line, and leased it in perpetuity from 1 January 1866. The Dartmouth and Torbay Railway Company then existed only as a financial entity and was absorbed in 1872.


=== Docks at Plymouth ===
In 1850 the South Devon Railway formed a rail connection at Millbay to the Millbay Pier of the Plymouth Great Western Dock Company, which was enlarging and improving the Millbay dock accommodation.The SDR itself was making a branch from Laira to Sutton Harbour, and this opened in May 1853; horse traction only was permitted at first and the line was formed by conversion of the south-western extremity of the Plymouth and Dartmoor Railway line. The branch was closed from May 1856 until October 1857, during which time it was realigned to ease some very sharp curves. From April 1869 locomotives were used.


=== Cornwall Railway ===
The Cornwall Railway opened its broad gauge line on 4 May 1859, from Cornwall Junction, a short distance north of the South Devon's Plymouth station. Cornwall Railway trains used the station, which was enlarged to handle the additional traffic. (It remained simply ""Plymouth"" until renamed Plymouth Millbay on 1 May 1877.)


=== Tavistock: and then Launceston ===
Tavistock was an important town lying to the north of Plymouth, and after considerable parliamentary struggles, the South Devon and Tavistock Railway was authorised in the 1854 session of Parliament to build its broad gauge line from a junction east of Laira to Tavistock. It opened that line on 22 June 1859; it was leased to, and worked by the South Devon Railway until it was purchased by them, effective from July 1865.The gauge wars were the struggle for possession of territory between railway companies that used the broad gauge and the standard gauge respectively; the SDR used the broad gauge and was allied with (and exchanged traffic with) other broad gauge lines. In 1861 narrow gauge interests sought to penetrate into north Devon and north Cornwall, and as a defensive measure the SDR promoted an extension of the Tavistock line to Launceston. This was done through the medium of a separate company, the South Devon and Launceston Railway, which obtained Parliamentary authority in 1862. The line opened for passenger traffic on 1 July 1865 and to goods in October 1865. It was worked by the SDR and absorbed by it at the end of 1873.
As the line was promoted as an obvious attempt to frustrate narrow gauge intentions to enter the area, Parliament inserted a clause into the Launceston Act requiring narrow gauge rails to be laid if requested by an connecting Company, if so ordered by the Board of Trade. This later enabled trains of the London and South Western Railway to reach Plymouth over the South Devon lines.


=== Moretonhampstead ===
Also encouraged as a tactical measure to frustrate narrow gauge incursion, the Moretonhampstead and South Devon Railway was promoted locally, the South Devon Railway subscribing £500 of the £105,000 capital. The line opened on 4 July 1866; it was 12 miles (19 km) long and climbed steadily from Newton (Abbot) to Moretonhampstead, gaining 550 feet (168 m) on the journey through Teigngrace and Bovey.


=== Brixham ===
The Torbay and Brixham Railway was built independently, and almost solely due to the efforts of a local proprietor of the fishing harbour, R W Wolston. The line opened on 28 February 1868 between Brixham Road station, on the Dartmouth and Torbay Railway line, to Brixham. Brixham Road station was renamed Churston on the same day. The line was worked by the SDR until 1876, when a dispute over charges and commission led the little company to work its own line for a period. In 1883 the line was sold to the Great Western Railway for £12,000.


=== Buckfastleigh ===
The Buckfastleigh, Totnes and South Devon Railway was incorporated in 1863, taking powers to extend its proposed line to Ashburton in 1864. It opened between Totnes and Ashburton on 1 May 1872, and added a branch to Totnes Quay on 10 November 1873. At  first the Totnes Quay branch was worked by horses, any mechanical power being prohibited, but this rule was removed and locomotive power used as far as the level crossing from 24 August 1874.


=== Exeter City Basin ===
The South Devon Railway added a quayside branch to the Exeter Canal at City Basin on 17 July 1867.


== Progress 1849 to 1876 ==


=== Line capacity ===
In 1849 the company had completed its main line to Plymouth, and the Torquay branch; it was in an alliance with the Bristol and Exeter Railway and the Great Western Railway, and the friendly Cornwall Railway was constructing its main line; the SDR therefore formed part of a broad gauge network connecting Devon, and soon Cornwall, with Bristol and London. However its main line was single track only with difficult gradients and it had expended its financial resources on the abortive atmospheric system, and very soon rapidly increasing demand became the dominant problem.
In the summer of 1850 the line was overwhelmed by the traffic offering, and some trains took six hours to run from Plymouth to Exeter due to congestion. The configuration of the passing places may have been largely responsible. A start was made on improving line capacity by doubling the line from Aller to Totnes, which including the difficult climbs to the summit at Dainton; from Newton to Aller the Torquay branch had run parallel to the main line, and the two single tracks were converted to a double line, with a new junction being formed at Aller. The double track was put into use on 29 January 1855. In the same period layout improvements were made at the crossing places at Dawlish, Teignmouth and Kingsbridge Road, and at Totnes, this work being completed in 1856, and in August 1856 the Chairman announced that it was not planned to double any further sections of the route.
The company sought powers to widen some remaining sections in the 1859 Parliamentary session, and in the period to 1865 the line was doubled from the west end of the Exe Bridge at Exeter to Starcross, and from Teignmouth west end to Newton.
A further series of capacity improvements took place from 1874 to 1875, when a third track was laid from Newton to Aller, restoring the independent access to the Torquay branch; and Starcross to Dawlish was doubled.


=== Station improvements ===
Following the completion of the main line, new stations were opened at Exminster and Cornwood in 1852.
The Plymouth station, at Millbay, was designed as a simple terminal for the SDR. When the Cornwall Railway was nearing completion, the Plymouth station was expanded to accommodate that company's traffic, an apportionment of the capital and running costs being agreed. The enlargement was ready for the opening of the Cornwall line on 4 May 1859, but already the Tavistock and South Devon line was nearing completion, and would bring more traffic to Plymouth. Further extensive improvements were put in hand and substantially complete by 1863.


== Amalgamation and after ==
The company was amalgamated with the Great Western Railway (GWR) on 1 February 1876; subsequent development of the SDR system is summarised here.
Shortly after the amalgamation the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) arrived in Plymouth and a joint station was opened at North Road. The LSWR had long wished to reach Devon and Cornwall, but its early aspirations had been frustrated, and it was not until 1860 that it reached Exeter. Gradual extensions, in some cases using nominally independent promoters, resulted in its reaching Lidford (spelt Lydford from 1897) on 12 October 1874. The Launceston and South Devon Railway had been absorbed by the South Devon Railway in 1869, but under the terms of the L&SDR authorising Act, it was required to lay narrow gauge rails when requested by any connecting narrow gauge line. Consequently, the SDR had to lay a narrow gauge rail, forming mixed gauge track, from Lidford to Plymouth, and to allow LSWR trains to run over the line. However the SDR managed to prevaricate and delay the actual running of the LSWR trains to Plymouth until 17 May 1876.
The gauge on all remaining lines was converted to 4 ft 8+1⁄2 in (1,435 mm) standard gauge on 21 May 1892. Previous to this, the line from Tavistock Junction to North Road in Plymouth had been mixed gauge to allow the London and South Western trains to travel over the broad gauge tracks. Similarly, one of the two tracks from Exeter as far as City Basin had been mixed. The conversion to standard gauge for the entire Exeter to Plymouth section was carried out after the last broad gauge train that ran to Plymouth on Friday 20 May had returned empty to Swindon depot (where it was immediately scrapped). The work was complete ready for the first standard gauge train to run on Monday 23 May.
The GWR had taken possession of a busy main line that still included single line sections from Dawlish to the Old Quay beyond Teignmouth station, and from Rattery summit to Hemerdon. In July 1884 the section from the west end of Parson's Tunnel to Teignmouth Old Quay was doubled; this included opening out the 320-yard (290 m) East Cliff Tunnel at Teignmouth. The next section dealt with from Rattery to Hemerdon was more challenging, involving five large new masonry viaducts as well as Marley Tunnel; the double line was opened in stages progressively in 1893, completing on 19 November 1893. This left a short section through five tunnels west of Dawlish: this was taken on from 1902, being completed and opened on 1 October 1905.The Great Western Railway was nationalised on 1 January 1948. From that date, the former South Devon Railway became the responsibility of British Railways, Western Region.


== Route ==
After leaving the former Bristol and Exeter Railway station at Exeter St Davids, the line crosses the River Exe and then passes through the southern margin of Exeter along a stone viaduct. Once out in the countryside it follows the Exe southwards down to Dawlish Warren, passing at the edge of rocky cliffs through short tunnels and the longer Parson's Tunnel to Teignmouth. Here turning west it follows the north bank of the River Teign to Newton Abbot, where the company's workshops were located.
Beyond Newton Abbot the main line climbs up a sustained two-mile (3.2 km) gradient of 1 in 36 (2.78%) at the steepest point to a summit at Dainton Tunnel, then falling for four miles (6.4 km) gradients nearly as steep to cross the River Dart at Totnes. It then climbs steeply again at up to 1 in 47 (2.13%) for three miles (4.8 km) to a summit at Rattery, then easing a little for six miles (9.7 km) of moderately steep climb to Wrangaton. From there it falls for six miles (9.7 km) on moderately steep gradients to Hemerdon, there descending at 1 in 42 (2.38%) for two miles (3.2 km) to Plympton. From there the line follows the north bank of the River Plym, passing through a tunnel near Mutley, running to the present-day Plymouth station. Beyond there, a short length of the main line to Cornwall is formed of the original main line, after which the line turned south to the original terminus at Millbay; this is no longer in existence.
The Torquay branch diverges from the main line a little south-west of Newton abbot at Aller Junction, and climbs to Torre station high on the north-west edge of Torquay itself.

== Locomotives ==

The company hired locomotives from the Great Western Railway to haul their trains until the atmospheric system was ready for operation. In the event, locomotives were needed on a more permanent basis and so a series of contracts were entered into with contractors to provide the power for the trains. From 1867 the company bought the locomotives and operated them.
The South Devon Railway also operated all the connecting branches in Devon and so their locomotives operated on these. The Cornwall Railway also contracted their motive power from the same company as the South Devon Railway. From 1867 the South Devon Railway also bought the Cornwall Railway locomotives and operated them as a single fleet with their own, and also the ones now purchased for the West Cornwall Railway.
Most of the locomotives were 4-4-0 tank engines for passenger trains and 0-6-0 tank engines for goods trains. Later some smaller locomotives were purchased for branch lines and the dock branches.


== Accidents and incidents ==
On 27 June 1849, the boiler of Great Western Railway Hercules class locomotive Goliah exploded whilst it was hauling a freight train at Plympton. One person was killed.

The Kabinettsgarten adjoins the Allerheiligen-Hofkirche.


== History ==
In the mid-19th century, the courtyard was built on the eastern edge of the residence, which was surrounded by a wall and could only be entered through a narrow opening. Originally a fountain stood in the middle of the lawn, which was bordered by four linden trees along the courtyard wall and a wooden pergola. In the 20th century, the garden became overgrown and was used as a vegetable garden or as a chicken farm.In 2002, the Bavarian Ministry of Finance decided that the garden be redesigned by the landscape architect Peter Kluska. The construction lasted from October 2002 to June 2003, and its costs are stated to be 437,000 Euros.


== Layout ==
The small garden of 1000 m2 fills a niche in the building gable of the residence. It is accessible to the general public from Marstallplatz. In addition, a newly created outside staircase leads from the inside of the residence to the garden. It can be reached from events at the Allerheiligen-Hofkirche, the foyer of the Cuvilliés Theatre and the Brunnenhof.Through the narrow entrance, visitors are led to a small square with a sculpture by the sculptor Fritz Koenig. The subsequent middle ground is bounded by shallow water surfaces with geometric mosaics, which are in turn edged by narrow strips of grass. At the opposite end is again a small square with a round, low fountain lined with four plane trees whose crowns are cut to grow together into a common roof. At the edges of the garden are side paths, so you can walk around the entire area. All around are benches where visitors can settle.
Floor slabs, steps and stone blocks are of very light limestone and loosen up the warm earth tones of the facades. The shallow pools have a dark base made of orthogneiss, which are divided by white stripes of glass stones. In them, a regular pattern of red and green glass surfaces is incorporated. Water and light give movement to the patterns.
The garden was honored at the Deutscher Landschaftsarchitekturpreis 2005 (German Landscape Architecture Award) and was nominated for the DBA Prize 2006. It is described as a ""little gem"" that conveys a ""serene atmosphere"" and ""enchanting mood.""

== Series description ==
Plot summaries have been moved to their individual volume pages.The story of Mia Thermopolis' adolescent turmoil as an average teenager and, as she later finds out, a princess of royal descent (her father), is chronicled in her on-going journal. Here she explores topics of teenage angst, romance, and heartbreak as she lives and learns from them. The main series follows Mia from her freshman year of high school to her graduation, with a two-year jump between the ninth and tenth books and an eight year jump from the tenth to eleventh.


== Setting ==
The series is set primarily in the Manhattan borough of New York City. Some books take place in Genovia, a fictional European country. Genovia is a principality between France and Italy ruled by Mia's father, Prince Philippe Renaldi, and by Mia's grandmother, Queen Clarisse Renaldi.


== Characters ==


=== Mia Thermopolis ===
Amelia Mignonette Grimaldi Thermopolis Renaldo is the protagonist of the series. She is the daughter of Helen Thermopolis, a painter and Philippe Renaldi, the prince of Genovia. Mia is also the current Princess Regent of Genovia.
Having spent most of her life in Greenwich Village with her mother, Mia attends Albert Einstein High School, a private school in Manhattan's Upper East Side. Mia chronicles the main aspects of her life in various personal diaries, through which she also later develops her talent for various forms of writing. She prefers to be called Mia, although her best friend Lilly often bestows upon her nicknames such as BL (Baby Licker), POG (Princess Of Genovia), or PIT (Princess In Training).
Mia is sometimes shy and has a down-to-earth personality, though on occasion Mia shows herself to be quite sarcastic and sly. Throughout the series she is very self-critical of herself, describing herself as flat-chested, taller than most girls at 5-foot-9, and with embarrassingly large feet. She also has a tendency to over-analyze things and worry too much. 
Mia's spends her afternoons throughout the series with her grandmother (Grandmere) in princess lessons, where her grandmother attempts to teach Mia the finer points of being a princess. In these lessons, Mia is taught an array of royal lessons, such as fashion sense, meal etiquette, proper manners when mingling with other royals, and relationship advice. Mia is also taught about royal duties such as her visits during school breaks to Genovia and the events she must attend and speak at as a royal throughout the year.
Mia develops an interest in writing during the series. Later in the series, Mia writes her own novel called Ransom My Heart, though she composes many poems, lists, and even screenplays throughout her years of writing in her diary. Mia, having been raised almost exclusively by her very liberal and feminist painter mother, is very socially conscientious; She is a vegetarian and also tries to use her fame to raise awareness for good causes, including donations to Greenpeace with the money her father pays her to take princess lessons from her grandmother. Between the tenth and eleventh books, Mia goes to college and establishes a youth community center.
Mia's friendship with Lilly Moscovitz is a focal point of the series. Though they often clash due to Mia's insecurity and Lilly's forcefulness, they remain best friends until major conflicts arise in the later books of the series.
Another central plot line of the books is Mia's relationship with Michael Moscovitz, Lilly's older brother. Their relationship survives obstacles throughout several books of the series, such as their age difference and Mia's (often overwrought) anxieties, as Mia works out how to effectively manage romantic relationships as a maturing adolescent.
In Disney's The Princess Diaries 2001, Mia (who was portrayed by Anne Hathaway) is aged 15, unlicensed, and owns a 1965 Mustang. She has similar qualities, but her father dies two months prior to where the movie begins, and her last name is Renaldi instead of Renaldo. She lives in San Francisco instead of New York.


=== Clarisse Marie Grimaldi Renaldi ===
Clarisse Maria was formally known as the Dowager Princess Clarisse Marie Grimaldi Renaldi.
Clarisse is the dowager princess of Genovia and Mia's paternal grandmother. Mia refers to her as ""Grand-mère"" (French for ""Grandmother""). As a young woman, she married Prince Rupert Renaldi and had two sons. She habitually omits Mia's mother's surname ""Thermopolis"" from her granddaughter's lengthy list of names and titles, much to Mia's annoyance. She speaks French most of the time, but she can also speak English; however, she disdains English as a vulgar language. She is almost always accompanied by her miniature poodle, Rommel, who is notable for having a severe case of OCD that causes him to lick his own fur off. She smokes often and enjoys drinking sidecars. She is not hesitant about lying or manipulating others in order to get her own way.
She and Mia don't see eye to eye: Clarisse is concerned with attracting publicity to Genovia and ensuring Mia does not embarrass her country while Mia prefers to focus on politics. Though she and Mia butt heads often, she does care for her granddaughter and gives her advice about love and relationships that Mia takes with a grain of salt due to her grandmother's cold nature. For example, when Clarisse was married to the king of Genovia, she led him to believe that she was only interested in his status and money and never once said ""I love you"", in order to keep her husband on his toes. Mia also mentions that her father is terrified of his mother because she would lock him in the palace dungeons whenever he misbehaved (although when she informs him that he gives the appearance of being a little bit scared of Clarisse in Princess in the Spotlight, her father replies that he is not scared of his mother and that she really isn't as bad as Mia thinks; in his view, Clarisse ""just needs proper handling"").
While in New York to give Mia her princess lessons, the dowager princess resided in the Plaza Hotel and was dissatisfied with other quality luxury hotels she was placed in during Princess On the Brink, when the Plaza was being remodeled.


=== Lilly Moscovitz ===
Mia's best friend since kindergarten, Lilly is a highly intelligent and opinionated person who has her own public-access television show, titled Lilly Tells It Like It Is, in which she discusses political and social issues. By the end of the series, her TV show is picked up by a network and is apparently very popular in South Korea.
Mia admires Lilly's bravery and unwillingness to be pushed around by others, though Lilly knows her insensitivity and forceful personality can cause her to be disliked. Mia and Lilly often enjoy discussing popular culture, but Lilly's strong stances often cause her and Mia to clash, especially when Mia feels Lilly is becoming too critical of her. Nevertheless, Lilly's blunt attitude is what often keeps Mia from over-analyzing things, such as her relationship with Michael, Lilly's older brother. Mia was initially afraid to share her crush on Michael with Lilly, but in fact, Lilly was one of the conspirators who helped Mia and Michael get together in Princess in Love.
Lilly is not considered to be very pretty; Mia often describes her face as being ""squashed in like a pug's"". However, she has a well-developed figure, which earns her several romantic suitors, including Boris Pelkowski, Mia's cousin Hank, Jangbu the immigrant busboy, J.P. Reynolds, and Kenny Showalter. Boris is Lilly's first boyfriend, but the relationship ends when she begins seeing Jangbu in Princess in Pink. In Party Princess, Lilly hooks up with J.P., but he dumps her in Princess On the Brink. Lilly becomes angry at Mia when she finds out that Mia kissed J.P., and refuses to speak to her anymore, going so far as to start a website called 'ihatemiathermopolis.com'. Lilly ignores Mia's attempts to make up until she finds out that Mia is planning to lose her virginity to J.P., when she tells Mia about his lies and plans to use Mia's fame to his own advantage. Lilly also helps indirectly repair Mia and Michael's relationship. The girls make up and become best friends again; they are still close by the events of Royal Wedding, with Lilly now attending Columbia Law School.
In the 2001 Disney Movie, Lilly, portrayed by Heather Matarazzo, is portrayed as intelligent, confident, and socially conscious. Her talk show is called ""Shut Up and Listen"". She is then a student at Berkeley. In The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement, Mia appoints Lilly as her royal secretary.


=== Michael Moscovitz ===
Lilly's older brother, and Mia's main love interest throughout the series. Mia states that she has been in love with Michael since the day he came over to give Lilly a school project when they were in the first grade and he was in the fourth. From the end of the first book to the third, Mia has an unrequited crush on Michael, which he finally reciprocates in Princess in Love. Their relationship continues through Mia's sophomore year and Michael's first year at Columbia University, but their relationship becomes slightly strained when Michael tells Mia he would like to have sex, while Mia would prefer to wait until her prom night. Michael respects Mia's wishes but when Michael gets an offer to move to Japan, he believes it would be easier for their relationship as he is ""tired of taking cold showers"". Mia proposes sex in order to keep him from leaving but is upset to find out that he slept with Judith Gershner before they began dating, and the two break up. Michael believes Mia is overreacting and attempts to reconcile with her before leaving for Japan, but is hurt to find her sharing a kiss with J.P. Mia attempts to reunite and work out the distance situation but Michael decides that it is best they remain ""just friends"" and they begin a regular email correspondence. When Michael returns from Japan after an absence of almost two years, he flirts with Mia during her interview for the school paper. Mia notices that Michael still looks incredibly hot and realises that she does still, indeed, love him. The two eventually kiss, despite Mia having a boyfriend, and Michael declares that he still loves Mia and will wait for her. They reunite on Mia's prom night and have sex.
Michael has brown eyes and thick, dark hair and is tall. He is extremely handsome, nice, funny, smart, and manly, despite staying cooped up writing songs or on his computer the whole day. Mia insists that he is the third best-looking guy at AEHS after Josh Richter and Justin Baxendale and describes his nose as aquiline, mouth as ""eminently kissable"", and neck as aromatic due to an intoxicating blend of Tide from his shirt collar, his Gillette shaving foam, and Ivory soap.
Michael is described as romantic and talented. Though he often clashes with his younger sister, Michael and Lilly are in fact close siblings and friends. He used to run his own webzine, Crackhead,  but had to disband it after an editorial stating the merits of Linux over Windows, which caused a loss of advertisers and funds. Shortly after this, Michael starts a band called Skinner Box (a name suggested by Mia) with a few friends, including Boris Pelkowski.
Michael loves Mia just as she is, though her neurotic behavior and insecurity frustrate him. In fact, Michael is the one who often feels insecure in their relationship, because he knows Grandmere does not think he is an appropriate consort, and all the gossip magazines would much rather prefer to see Mia date a fellow royal or celebrity like James Franco or (as Mamaw suggests) Zac Efron. He moves to Japan to develop the CardioArm for this reason, believing it would prove to the world that he is, in fact, worthy of dating a princess. Michael returns to New York a multi-millionaire and the president/owner of his own robotics company, Pavlov Robotics, named after his dog.  Michael donates a robot arm to Genovia from his company for free even though the waiting list is long, helping Mia's father win the election. Mia realizes that she is still in love with Michael, but tries to convince herself otherwise. When she and Michael kiss on a coach ride, however, she writes, ""I can't do this to J.P. I just can't. Oh my God, though, I love Michael so much."" When J.P. and Mia split due to J.P using her and lying to her, she and Michael reunite, spending the night together. 


=== Tina Hakim Baba ===
A student at AEHS, Tina is the daughter of a Saudi Arabian oil sheik and a British former supermodel. Because of her father's status, she has to have the protection of a bodyguard, Wahim, which isolates her from the other students until Mia sits with her after a fight with Lilly in the first novel. The three girls quickly develop a solid friendship, and Tina eventually uses her generous weekly allowance to support Lilly's public-access television show. She first goes out with Dave Farouq-El-Abar from another school, 'Trinity', and after he breaks up with her, she begins dating Boris Pelkowski. After Mia and Lilly's estrangement at the end of the eighth novel, Mia comes to see Tina as her best friend. Tina constantly reads romance novels, making Mia consider her an expert in romance. Though prone to imaginative flights of fancy and often a little silly, Tina can be extremely acute about both academic and social matters. She is very loyal to Mia, who often consults her for sensitive advice rather than the harsher Lilly. Tina also believes that she must remain pure, because she dreams that one day, she will marry Prince William, and to do so, she must remain a virgin, though she admits to having slept with Boris by Forever Princess. She becomes a medical student at New York University, and has broken up with Boris by the beginning of book eleven, though they eventually get back together.


=== Secondary characters ===
Lars van der Hooten: Mia's very protective Swedish bodyguard. He voices his mind in a way that is annoying when he thinks Mia is being particularly ridiculous, but goes along with her schemes anyway. He also turns a blind eye to Mia and Michael when they make out, for which Mia is grateful. He gets on very well with Michael (especially in the first book when Lars seems to know that Michael likes Mia), never offers any opinion on Lilly, and becomes friends with Tina's bodyguard, Wahim. Lars also likes Mia's French teacher Mademoiselle Klein. He is known to be a 'big softie' deep down inside.
Helen Thermopolis: Mia's mother. She has a career as an artist and spends most of her time in her studio, and becomes pregnant with Frank's son and Mia's half brother Rocky in the second book. According to Mia, she is very pretty and her neck smells of Dove (soap), turpentine and coffee, but according to Mia's dad, her neck smells of freesias. She clearly wants the best for her daughter and is very carefree.
Frank Gianini: Mia's algebra and homeroom teacher. He dates her mother, Helen, and marries her when she becomes pregnant with Mia's half-brother, Rocky. He plays the drums, which annoys the neighbors. He is unfazed by his stepdaughter's fame, and treats her the same as every other student during class; he also ""has a thing about cell-phone usage during class time"", as Lana finds out in Princess in Waiting. Mia grows to appreciate his after-school algebra review sessions, and though their relationship begins awkwardly, Mia and Mr. G seem to get along well after the seventh installment. He passes away from a heart attack before the eleventh book, and Mia names her community center after him.
John Paul ""J.P."" Reynolds Abernathy IV: Initially known as ""The Guy Who Hates It When They Put Corn In the Chili,"" J.P. meets Mia via Grandmère's school musical in Party Princess. He joins Mia's friend group soon after, and begins to date Lilly at the end of the book. J.P. is first described as having ""broad shoulders, floppy brown hair, and surprisingly blue eyes,"" though several characters later state that Mia and J.P. look good together because they are both so ""tall and blond."" He breaks up with Lilly in book eight, and kisses Mia after her breakup with Michael. They grow closer in book nine, with shared interests in musicals and writing, and begin dating after he confesses his love for Mia. They break up in the last book when Mia finds out that he used her to further his playwriting career, and lied about saving his virginity for her. By Royal Wedding, he is an unsuccessful screenwriter and novelist, and continues attempting to reconcile with Mia. Michael later discovers that he is RoyalRabbleRouser - an Internet blogger posting vicious comments about Mia - and has him reported to Interpol.
Boris Pelkowski: A Russian violin virtuoso, and Lilly's boyfriend until book five. His habits include tucking his sweater into his pants, breathing through his mouth, and playing the violin in Gifted and Talented class, when everyone else wants him to be quiet. After Lilly dumps him, he starts dating Tina Hakim Baba. During the summer before sophomore year, he lifts weights, gets laser eye surgery and becomes (by Mia's standards) a hottie. Boris is a ""say it like it is or say nothing at all"" sort of guy. He becomes friends with Michael after joining his band, and in the ninth installment, it appears that they remain in contact, as he implores Mia to respond to Michael's emails so that he won't think she's 'forgotten' about him. By the eleventh book, he has become a popstar known as 'Boris P'. Tina breaks up with him when she finds photos of him with another girl, but they get back together at Mia and Michael's wedding when he proves that they were photoshopped.
Josh Richter: Lana Weinberger's boyfriend until the fifth book. He is on the crew team and is co-valedictorian. Mia describes him as the most attractive boy in school; he is very tall and muscular and has ""electric"" blue eyes. At the end of the first book, Josh takes Mia to the Cultural Diversity Dance, where he kisses her on the entrance steps of her school. Realizing that he used her to enter the media spotlight, Mia dumps him afterwards and tries to avoid him, even though this is difficult because of their adjacent lockers.
Lana Weinberger: A popular junior cheerleader with long blonde hair, a peaches-and-cream complexion, baby blue eyes and a voluptuous figure. She dates Josh Richter from the start of the series until the summer break between the fifth and sixth books, when they split up after he goes to college. Lana has a younger sister, Gretchen, who starts at AEHS in book eight and has a very similar personality.  Lana is very spiteful towards Mia and constantly taunts her until a major shift in book nine, when she offers the olive branch after Lilly and Mia's friendship ends. They become good friends, with Mia noting that Lana is actually a nice but misunderstood person, though she is sometimes frustrated by Lana's shallowness.
Shameeka Taylor: One of Mia's friends, she has an overprotective father. She is athletic and the most attractive of Mia's friends, but also sensible, and headstrong, joining the cheerleading team because she is tired of letting Lana push her around. After she joins the cheerleaders, Lana claims that the African-American Shameeka was put on the team to ""fill our freak quota"". Nevertheless, Shameeka becomes quite popular, apparently leaving Mia's group in books seven and eight while remaining on friendly terms, but returning in book nine when Lana and Trisha become friends with Mia. In book eleven, Mia mentions that she now works in marketing for Vera Wang.
Ling Su Wong: An Asian American artist friend of Mia's with illegible ""artist handwriting"". She admires Mia's mother Helen, mainly because they are both talented artists. Mia thinks she is very pretty; in the first book, she is apparently asked out seven times. In book seven, she is the treasurer for Mia's school government until they go broke. She concentrates more on academic matters rather than things such as prom and dating, though Mia likes her despite her nerdiness. In the tenth book, she goes to prom with Perin, and they become a couple by the eleventh book.
Prince René of Italy: First seen in the fourth novel, René is Mia's distant cousin. Clarisse tries to fix them up, but fails because of their mutual lack of interest. He is described as devilishly handsome; Mia notes that he has a ""impressing"" six-pack, accentuated by the tiny Speedos he enjoys wearing on the beach. His exploits include playing strip-tennis with a government official's wife, strip bowling with Lilly and the other royals, entertaining topless sunbathers in the pool house, disappearing with a prime minister's eighteen-year-old daughter, and photo-copying his nether-region in the palace administration office. After being deposed from his ancestral palace, which is bought by a shoe designer, Rene resides at the Palais de Genovia. In the ninth installment, René impregnates Contessa Trevanni's niece, Bella, and they are suddenly married; although the circumstances sound unfavorable, their marriage seems happy. In the tenth book, he runs against Mia's dad for Prime Minister of Genovia, but loses.
""Mamaw"" Shirley Thermopolis and ""Papaw"" Thermopolis: Helen's mother and father from Versailles, Indiana, whom she constantly feuds with. Nevertheless, they keep in touch, and are portrayed in the second novel as perfect stereotypes of the ""small-town"" American lifestyle. Helen tries to contact them as little as possible, due to their disapproval of her decision to keep Mia and her liberal upbringing.
Hank Thermopolis: Mia's handsome cousin, who has spent most of his life in Indiana with his grandparents. When they visit Helen and Mia in Manhattan, he disappears with Lilly Moscovitz. Mia thinks they are in love, but he merely confesses to Lilly his secret desire to become a model, and Lilly helps him sign up with Elite Model Agency and land a contract with Calvin Klein. His Hoosier drawl then disappears. From then on, he stays in New York and becomes a famous underwear model.
Kenneth ""Kenny"" Showalter: Mia's first boyfriend. Kenny is good at biology and chemistry, and a fan of anime. He wants to discover a cure for cancer when he becomes older. It is hinted that his feelings for Mia are still romantic even after they break up. In book six, he pretends to have a ""perfect"" girlfriend named Heather, but later admits that he invented her to make Mia jealous. Kenny later forms a much more requited and equal relationship with Lilly, who is more similar to him than Mia is, and they end up going to Columbia together. Like Mia, Kenny is tall, blond and skinny, and Mia thinks he is pretty cute, but finds the idea of kissing him revolting.
Perin Thomas: A new student at AEHS introduced in book six. At first, Mia can't figure out whether Perin is a boy or a girl. She turns out to be a girl and eventually joins Mia's friend group, though she is again mistaken for a boy in Grandmère's musical, in which she is given a male role. Perin is one of Mia's 'nicer' friends, and is also surprisingly strong and well-mannered. In book ten, it is implied that Perin and Ling Su are romantically involved with each other, though this is not confirmed until the eleventh book, when they are shown running the Frank Gianini Community Center with Mia.
Trisha Hayes: Introduced in book six, one of Lana's cronies who helps terrorize Mia, but later befriends her at Lana's whim. Like Lana, Trisha is a pretty, popular mean girl, though Mia comments that Geometry teacher Mr. Harding once made her cry over her isosceles triangles.
Judith Gershner: A friend of Michael, whom Mia suspects of having romantic feelings for him. She later becomes the cause of Mia and Michael's breakup in book eight when it is revealed that he lost his virginity to her, but did not tell Mia about it. She is known for being able to clone fruit flies.
Karen Martinez: An overly critical English teacher who continually demands more from Mia's writing, though this may be an excuse to personally pick on Mia; Mia and J.P. decide that it is simply because she doesn't like their writing style. Tina thinks she is very pretty, comparing her to Maggie Gyllenhaal, and often comments on her clothes, but turns against her after Mrs. Martinez gives Mia a B in English in book six. Later, after Mia makes an awesome speech about why she should be elected student body president and is later elected, Mrs. Martinez congratulates Mia for her speech, saying she was right about popular culture having its place just like high culture; she then apologizes to Mia for making her feel that the things Mia enjoys writing about were less than more serious subjects, as they weren't.
Rocky Thermopolis-Gianini: Mia's half-brother, the son of her mother, Helen, and her algebra teacher, Mr. Gianini. Mia is incredibly over-protective of him, so much that Helen seems to be irritated that Mia thinks her mother is incapable of raising her second child.  Lilly has also expressed that she thinks Mia is over-protective of him, repeatedly calling her a baby-licker in book six. Rocky is very cute but slightly overweight.
Sebastiano Grimaldi: Mia's second cousin, and second in line to the throne of Genovia after Mia. He is an up-and-coming fashion designer who designs some of Mia's gowns, and often has trouble pronouncing multi syllable words (example: ""butt"" instead of ""butter""). He once took photos of Mia trying on dresses, but apologizes by making her a nice dress for the Non-denominational Winter Dance, which turns out to be the best night of Mia's life. In the tenth book, it is revealed that he becomes a famous fashion designer, and even has a line of jeans in Walmart.
Ruth and Morty Moscovitz: Michael and Lilly's parents, both psychoanalysts. They separate in book seven, but begin to rekindle their relationship in book eight. As shown in the seventh installment, they tend to focus too much on their own lives and concerns. When they do broach sensitive subjects with their children, they usually psychoanalyze them as well, a habit that has a very bad effect on Lilly, who inherits her intelligence and hobby of analyzing people from them. Michael, who is more perceptive, avoids their attention by keeping more to himself.
Olivia Grace Clarisse Mignonette Harrison Renaldi: First introduced in book eleven, Olivia is Mia's biracial 12-year-old half-sister, the daughter of Prince Philippe and Elizabeth, an American pilot. After her mother's death, she was raised by her aunt and uncle, who used Olivia's child support money for their personal means, and lives with them in Cranbrook, New Jersey, until Mia finds her. Like Mia, she keeps a diary which is used for the series spin-off, From the Notebooks of a Middle School Princess.

== Errata ==
On April 6, 2006,  Cabot announced a mistake on the back cover of her new book, Party Princess. In New Zealand and Australia, the picture on the back features Georgia Byng instead of Cabot.  She said, ""Don't worry. The copies of Princess Diaries 7 with Georgia Byng's picture on the back were pulled from shops, and swapped for copies of the book with the correct author's photo (mine) on the back.""
In December 2006, Cabot announced that a mistake had been made in the front cover summary of Valentine Princess. Since the book chronicles Mia glancing at her old diaries, the characters Boris and Tina were not dating, rather Boris and Lilly. On the book flap, however, it says Boris and Tina are a couple. Cabot has announced that this has been fixed by the publishing company. Tina was dating Dave Farouq El-Abar at the time of books one and two.
In the tenth book (Forever Princess) Mia is writing a novel for her senior project, though she keeps it a secret from everyone but Michael, until the end of the book. At the end however she reveals this to Tina and J.P. Tina reads it instantly and thinks it is about Mia and Michael; J.P. doesn't read it and this upsets Mia, which is part of the reason they break up. At the end of the book, Mia receives an offer to get it published. (When Mia shares this news with Michael, they celebrate and this leads to a kiss, which proves that they are still in love.) Meg Cabot published ""Mia's"" book Ransom My Heart that can be bought in bookstores under the author name Princess of Genovia Mia Thermopolis.

== Adaptations ==
In 2001 and 2004 respectively, two films based on the novels were produced by Walt Disney Pictures, The Princess Diaries and The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement starring Anne Hathaway and Julie Andrews respectively as Mia Thermopolis and Clarisse Renaldi. Cabot has thanked the films many times in interviews and on her website because she believes that they helped boost her book sales, as well as making her the success that she is today. The first season of the Netflix adult animated comedy series Q-Force features Stephanie Beatriz as Mira Popadopolous, based on Mia Thermopolis, whose backstory adapts the events of The Princess Diaries.


== Meta-references ==
Mia makes references in-universe to a movie made about her life. These relate to changes made for the real movie adaptations, including her father's death, differences in Grandmere's character, and a break-up with Michael in the sequel. Lilly complains that in the movie, the portrayal of her is mean and untrue, and Tina Hakim Baba was not allowed to be in it as her overprotective father forbade it for security reasons.
Mia also makes references to the other Princess books: in the fourth book, Mia says that there are already three or four unofficial biographies out there, and that one made the bestseller list for a few seconds.  The original The Princess Diaries novel did make the bestseller list.
The eighth novel mentions Samantha Madison and Jessica Mastriani, two heroines from other Meg Cabot books (All American Girl and 1-800-Where-R-You, respectively).

== Design and development ==
Officially designated as mine destructor vessels, the Cybele class was a large trimaran vessel, constructed using a steel lattice truss framework. They were intended to be towed through minefields that used pressure mines, creating a pressure wave that would detonate the mines; the open lattice construction of the ships would, according to the design, allow the blast to pass through the vessel without causing damage to it.The ships were constructed under conditions of the utmost secrecy; they were originally referred to as 'Sterling craft', then later designated as being part of the Algerine class of fleet minesweepers; their design was still classified as late as the late 1960s.


== Operational history ==
Two ships of the class were ordered by the Admiralty, in September 1943. HMS Cybele was constructed by William Denny and Brothers on the River Clyde, while HMS Cyrus was built at the Swan Hunter shipyards in Wallsend. Both ships were launched in January 1944; transferred to Scott Lithgow, located on the lower Clyde, for completion and fitting out, the two vessels were commissioned in May of that year.Both ships of the class saw use during Operation Overlord, the D-Day invasion of northern France; although the two vessels proved successful in operational service, when damaged they were difficult to control, being ""as difficult to handle as a battleship"". Cyrus was wrecked in the Seine Estuary in December 1944;Cybele survived the war, being scrapped in October 1946.

Two or three were bought by the French military and one by the Royal Navy just before World War I but its sales were overtaken by the superior Type G.


== Design and development ==
All Caudron biplane landplanes from before and into the First World War followed the same layout: tractor configuration, short nacelles, twin booms, large tailplanes and twin fins. From the Type A to the Type G.3, all were single engined. All types contained sesquiplane examples; the early types were modified from equal span biplanes and later ones, from the type E onwards, were sesquiplanes from the start. In contrast to its immediate predecessors, the Type C and Type D, the Type E was a two-seater, bigger and more powerful. It was designed as a military training aircraft.The two spar fabric covered wings had the same rectangular plan, apart from angled tips, and had an upper to lower span ratio close to 1.5. There were two wire braced bays on each side, though the inner ones were only about half the width of the outer. There was no stagger, so the interplane struts were parallel and vertical. The overhang of the upper wing was supported by parallel, outward leaning struts from the bases of the outer interplane struts. The rear spar was ahead of mid-chord, leaving the ribs in the rear part of the wing flexible and allowing roll control by wing warping.The two seat nacelle was developed from the earlier simple, flat sided structure of the Type B, supported above the lower wing on two more pairs of external interplane struts. It was larger, with more space for the two occupants and military equipment. The pilot was at the rear with the second seat forward; the upper fuselage ahead of the cockpit was raised, leaving the occupants less exposed. A 52 kW (70 hp) Gnome Lambda rotary engine was mounted in the front under a semi-circular cowling intended to deflect oil spray.The empennage of the Type E was supported on a pair of girders arranged parallel to one another in plan. The upper girder members were attached to the upper wing spars at the tops of the innermost interplane struts and the lower ones ran under the lower wing, mounted on downward extensions of the inner interplane struts. The mounting was strengthened with two diagonal struts on each side, one from the base of the forward interplane strut to the upcurved tip of the lower member and the other from the rear interplane strut to the junction of the lower member and its first vertical cross member. Each of these lower members, which supported the aircraft on the ground as skids, carried twin, rubber sprung landing wheels. Behind the wing the upper and lower members converged to the rear; the drag on the lower members shortened the landing run. The wingspans of the Type E were 0.5 m (1.6 ft) greater than those of the Type C with an increase of the inner bay width which placed the booms further apart and increased the undercarriage track from 2.4 to 3.0 m (8 to 10 ft), making landings easier. There were three vertical cross braces on each girder but the only lateral inter-girder cross-members were near the tail, though there was wire bracing. The broad chord, roughly rectangular, warping tailplane was mounted a little below the upper girder member. Above it, a pair of blunt cornered, rectangular rudders were separated by about one third of the tailplane span.


== Operational history ==
The French government received two Type Es, the first in September 1912 and the second a month later. Two more were built but proved hard to sell, probably because the superior Caudron Type G was becoming available. A Chinese order for Type Es was changed in favour of the newer type. One was sold to the Royal Navy though its acceptance was delayed until 29 June 1914 whilst modifications were made. The fate of the fourth and final Type E is uncertain, though it may have replaced the first French government machine after its loss in May 1913. If so, it had been modernized with the pointed, round edge form introduced on the Type F and used on all the G types.

== Niistaxo'ok ==
Wright held the name Niistaxo'ok, an hereditary name-title associated with chieftainship of the House of Niistaxo'ok, the clan Gispwudwada (Killerwhale clan) house-group (or matrilineal extended family) of the Gits'ilaasü (a.k.a. Kitselas) tribe. In the Prologue to Men of Medeek he summarized his chiefly position as follows: ""I have 'Power' on both sides of The Big Canyon [i.e. the Kitselas Canyon].  On the right hand side I have the power of my Chieftainship.  For many generations Neas-D-Hok [i.e. Niistaxo'ok] has had that right.  On the left hand side I carry the 'Power' of Neas Hiwas, for in my generation there is no Chief of that name.""  This is a reference to Niishaywaaxs, a house-chief name belonging to another Kitselas Gispwudwada house from the other side of Kitselas Canyon.  Niishaywaaxs had also been held by Wright's grandfather, whom he credited with teaching him the oral histories recorded in the book.
Wright was a river-boat pilot on the Skeena River, helming the Hudson's Bay Company sternwheelers, Mount Royal and Hazelton, work he performed until his eyesight began to fail.  In later years he was blind.  He was also an Envoy in the Salvation Army.


== Men of Medeek ==
Wright dictated Men of Medeek to Will Robinson, a local justice of the peace, in 1935–36, but it was not published until 1962, after Wright and Robinson had both died.  The oral clan histories (adawx) he tells include narrations of the coming of the Gispwudwada people to Kitselas Canyon and intersect with the exploits of Tsimshian Laxsgiik (Eagle clan) chiefs such as Ligeex of the Gispaxlo'ots and Gitxon of Kitselas.  The word ""medeek"" (midiik) is the Tsimshian word for grizzly-bear, one of the crests (""totems"") of Wright's branch of the Gispwudwada.  (Medeek (a.k.a. McDeek) Avenue in Terrace is so named because of Wright's totemic affiliation.)
Wright also recorded narratives in the 1920s and later with the trained Tsimshian ethnologist and chief William Beynon.


== Family ==
Wright had seven sisters, whose marriages were arranged so as to create matrikin and potential heirs (matrilineal nephews) in a variety of surrounding First Nations communities that figure in the adawx told in Men of Medeek, including Hartley Bay, Lax Kw'alaams, and Kitamaat.  (Wright's obituary referred to him as originally ""hailing from Kitimaat,"" though we know the key parts of his ancestry were Kitselas.)  One sister, Eliza, married Tom Thornhill, the first white settler in the Kitselas area. Wright died November 14, 1949, at the purported age of 84 years, although when he dictated Men of Medeek (1935–36) he gave his age as 65.  Other sources put his age at death as 104.  A newspaper report on his funeral services identified ""the new chief of the Kitselas people,"" Wright's picked successor, as Wright's sister's son, Walter Nyce, of Kitamaat, B.C.


== Chiefly succession ==
According to another account of the chiefly succession, Wright, late in life, visited his sister Rhoda Wright Bates, a Hartley Bay resident, at a Skeena River cannery where she was performing seasonal labour and asked that his matrilineal great-great-nephew Clarence Anderson, her grandson, then 14 years old, be taken ""back with him to be trained,"" also prearranging Clarence's eventual marriage; Anderson eventually succeeded to the name Niistaxo'ok.  (This version is from a published account by Anderson's wife, the anthropologist Margaret Seguin Anderson and daughter Tammy Anderson Blumhagen.)
Will Robinson's will urged his family to publish the remaining portion of the Wright manuscript, titled Wars of Medeek.  This proviso was forgotten until Robinson's granddaughter Enid DuPuis rediscovered Robinson's papers.  Another grandchild, Barry Robinson, then contacted Glenn Bennett, Chief Councillor of the Kitselas Band, and was put in touch with Wright's grandson, Ralph Wright, himself a former Chief Councillor who had remembered hearing the stories orally from his grandfather.  A limited edition comprising both Men of Medeek and Wars of Medeek was published by Barry Robinson in 2003 and gifted to the Kitselas Nation along with some 50 presentation books given to the Chiefs and dignitaries. All the original documentation and copyrights were given to the Kitselas Nations in 2003 by Barry Robinson.

Schmidt and Frota studied noticing in Schmidt as a Portuguese language learner and collected their findings through diary study and audio recordings. The hypothesis was modified in 1994 in light of criticism. 


== Overview ==
Schmidt posited that a learner cannot continue advancing their language abilities or grasp linguistic features unless they are consciously processing the input, and that what the learner actually notices is called ""intake"". This definition differs from that of Krashen's input hypothesis in which intake is similar to comprehensible input, and that of Chaudron which separates intake into preliminary intake and final intake. Therefore in order for the language someone is hearing to become salient and sent to long term memory where it can be used naturally, the learner must first actively be aware of aspects of language being presented to them.
Other terms that fall under the concept of conscious processing that was put forth by previous researchers include attention, short-term memory, control vs. automatic processing, and serial vs. parallel processing, but these topics were not unified under a single concept until Schmidt. Schmidt argued that noticing is not a replacement or a synonym for attention or any other term previously existing, but rather its own function in second language acquisition.
Susan Gass put forth a suggestion of a second noticing process. In this case, learners notice the gaps between their knowledge of the second language and that of what a native speaker would say.""Noticing"" differs from ""understanding"" in that the former refers to a finite moment where an aspect of language is understood and added to long term memory, rather than a general knowledge.


== Discovery ==
Schmidt's hypothesis stemmed from his own experiences within learning Portuguese in Brazil. In which he attended a five week course in the language, speaking to native speakers as supplement. Through working with Sylvia Frota and conducting monthly conversation recordings, they found that although explicit teaching of forms did not always become intake, linguistic features that he had been previously exposed to did not become apparent until they had been directly pointed out to him. Only after noticing something did Schmidt begin to use it. While noticing and the emergence of language appeared to be connected, Schmidt also noted that he repeated things that the other speaker said only in that conversation, but it did not become intake, nor did he use it in future conversations.Tracking the noticing process was first done through journal entries and recordings in Schmidt and Frota's 1986 study, in which a linguistic form was noticed and used more than once but not written down. Due to inconsistencies of memory, the main support for the noticing hypothesis comes from controlled environments. According to Cherry (1953) and  Kahneman and Treisman (1984) in an auditory shadowing study, subjects could concentrate on one auditory input but not two simultaneously. The input that was not focused on could only be recalled from the short-term memory if the input had stopped immediately before the task of recalling was asked. Therefore, Schmidt posits that input needs to be focused on explicitly to make it into the long-term memory.


== Amendments to the hypothesis ==
Four years after the original hypothesis was delivered, Schmidt updated it. He stated that noticing is helpful but is not required to learn different linguistic features of a language. He proposed that being able to notice more leads to more learning. However, it is not necessary for all learners to notice.


== Criticisms ==
The noticing hypothesis has received criticism from John Truscott, on two grounds. First, he argued that the basis for the noticing hypothesis in cognitive psychology is unclear. Second, he argued that there is even less certainty over how to interpret the noticing hypothesis in the field of language acquisition. Because Schmidt's hypothesis does not specifically target the grammar of natural language, the noticing hypothesis is too vague. Truscott argues that the noticing hypothesis should be limited to describing metalinguistic knowledge and not overall language competence.Tomlin and Villa (1994) argued that the use of diary studies was not an appropriate choice of material for this research as the actual instance of noticing is a short time frame compared to what the diary can encompass, but overall agreed with the idea that attention must exist for learning to take place. Meanwhile, Gass (1997) proposed that not all learning requires input, and Schlachter states that certain aspects of language do not require noticing while others do. Caroll (2006) argued that input in the environment does not contain the information needed to acquire a language and therefore invalidates the noticing hypothesis.
Nick Ellis also found that Schmidt's hypothesis misconstrued the processes of implicit learning. Ellis stated that noticing occurs only with new linguistic features that the learner encounters which they may find to be difficult.There is debate over whether learners must consciously notice something, or whether the noticing can be subconscious to some degree.


== Areas of further research ==
There exists little research regarding concepts such as cognitive style, depth of processing, self-regulation, and executive attention in the scope of the noticing hypothesis.

== History ==
Although East End residents are vague as to geographic lines that separate Audubon, Audubon Heights and Weaverton, farmers from the southern portion of the county knew Weaverton well from the 1870s until relatively recent times.
George Vogel started a general merchandise business in 1871; had a watering trough for the horses and refreshment for the farmer. In later years, two coal mines were opened, corn bins and a stockyard were built, so the farmer could exchange produce for necessities. Many times the ""trip to town"" stopped in Weaverton.
The Weaverton Milling Co. was formed in 1911 and in 1913 the Weaverton Lumber Company succeeded Ambrose Lumber Yards. The Kleymeyer Brickyards (1868) might be considered part of Weaverton, if Clay Street is accepted as the boundary, although Henry Kleymeyer's house was on a hill overlooking Audubon.

The old Weaverton grade school (east of Atkinson Street, off Pringle) existed as far back as 1889 and was torn down in 1916 or 1918. Both it and the old Audubon School were in the county system. In 1957, schools serving the neighborhood were desegregated. It is said that three young black males, James W. Clancey Jr., Shane Dunise Bushrod and Alvin Eugene Barnes, from the Brookstown neighborhood on US 60 at the west city limits, stepped forward to test whether the Declaration of Independence really meant that part about all men being treated equal. The three signed up to attend Weaverton Elementary School, being the first local black students ever to register to attend classes as equals with white students. The matter kicked off the incident where 570 White children walked out of Weaverton Elementary School protesting the enrollment of five Negro pupils. About half of the 872 children remained in class.In 1903 the Coquillard Wagon Works moved from South Bend, IN to its new plant in Weaverton, built right over the swimming hole the Vogel boys had been using. When local merchants and others bought stock, the name was changed to Henderson Wagon Works and 600 horse-drawn wagons were produced annually, until the money panic of 1913–14 caused Sears, Roebuck Co. to stop buying them. Later it was used by Heinz Cannery and Atlas Tack Co. The factory (near the north boundary of the Weaverton area) was destroyed by a massive fire during the summer of 1978. Witnesses reported that smoke and flame could be seen 10–15 miles to the west of the site on U.S. 60.

== Expedition ==
The first incident that led to the American expedition was in 1849 when the house owned by agent John Brown Williams was hit by cannon fire and burned. The Fijians were allegedly celebrating Independence Day when cannonballs fell on the building. The second incident happened the same year as the expedition when, again, fire was to interrupt John Williams's duties. After another accidental fire on Nukulau destroyed his store and some Fijians looted it. John Adams, under Commander Edward B. Boutwell, was sent to monitor the unrest in October and her crew were landed on more than one occasion to protect American interests. When Commander Boutwell heard of the incidents involving William's house and store, he demanded US$5,000 in compensation from King Cakobau. This initial claim was supplemented by further claims totalling $45,000. The natives received a deadline saying if they failed to pay, a landing party of marines and sailors would be sent ashore to capture the king in the island's village. Fijian warriors put up some resistance and one American service man was killed and two were wounded. Ultimately the men of John Adams were successful in routing a contingent of natives from Lautoka but Cakobau and the survivors escaped capture.
Cakobau's claim to be King of Fiji was by no means universally recognised by his fellow-chiefs, who jealously guarded the independence of their fiefdoms. His dilemma was that if he acknowledged the debt, he did not have sufficient funds to pay it, but that if he disclaimed it by saying that it fell under the jurisdiction of another chief, he would jeopardize his claim to the kingship, which he wanted foreign powers to recognize. He decided to bide his time, hoping that the Americans were only bluffing.
A second Fiji expedition in 1858, involving the crew of Vandalia, achieved clearer results, but in the end Cakobau never paid the debt.

","Sergey Antonov is a Russian-born cellist, living in the United States. In 2007 he was the gold prize winner at the International Tchaikovsky Competition.


== Biography ==
Born in Moscow in 1983 to two cellists, one a teacher at the Central Music School at the Moscow Conservatory, the other a Bolshoi Symphony Orchestra cellist, Antonov began studying the cello at age five. After graduating from the Moscow Conservatory, he studied at an advanced level with, among others, the legendary Mstislav Rostropovich. He is currently an Artist Diploma student at Boston's Longy School of Music.
In 2008, he inaugurated, together with pianist Constantine Finehouse, the Trieste Chamber Music Association's Salotto Cameristico to great acclaim.
Hailed as “…a brilliant cellist…” (M. Rostropovich) and “… a complete artist, 
both from the point of view of his unimpeachable technique and musically, with a 
cantabile quality and an energy that merge in a harmonious whole...” (Alberto Coda, 
Vita Nuova, Catholic Weekly of Trieste, Italy. May 2, 2008). Cellist Sergey Antonov 
“… literally spellbound the rapt audience ... with an expressive mastery of 
extraordinary maturity, realized through a technical skill exhibited without glitz but 
with the naturalness that characterizes a genial interpreter…” (Patrizia Ferialdi, Il 
Piccolo, Trieste, Italy. May 30, 2008).
In the summer of 2007, Sergey became one of the youngest cellists to win a Gold 
medal at the International Tchaikovsky Competition.
He has circled the globe, performing concerts in Japan, Korea, Bulgaria, Poland, 
Russia, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Sweden, Finland, United Arab Emirates and the 
US. He performs extensively with the most prominent orchestras, in the most 
prestigious halls of Russia, his home country, under the management of the Moscow 
Philharmony with whom he holds a five-year soloist contract.
In the summer of 2008, Sergey had made his American debut at the Newport 
Music Festival followed by solo recitals at Estivales de musique en medoc 2008 in 
Bordeaux, France, concerts in Savonlinna, Finland as well as in St. Petersburg, Russia. In July, he performed a live concert on the Boston’s radio show “Classics in the Morning” with Cathy Fuller on WGBH 89.7 FM.
Highlights of his 2008 season included a 10-concert tour of Japan and Korea in 
January/February, culminating with performances of the Brahms Double Concerto in 
Moscow's Great Hall of the Moscow Conservatory. Other performances included 
appearances with the Petrozavodsk Symphony, chamber music collaborations with the 
Lyrica Chamber Music Series as their ""Young Artist of the Year"", and the Chamber 
Music Foundation of New England. He gave solo concerts in Trieste, Italy and chamber 
music concerts in Dubai, that  were followed by concerts at the Great Hall of the 
Moscow Conservatory in performance of the Schumann cello concerto with Moscow 
Conservatory Symphony Orchestra . After his performance of the Elgar Cello Concerto 
with the Moscow Philharmonic in its ""Stars of The 21st Century” series, a critic wrote “…[Antonov] is …unique…from a different world...a musician who has his own inner space…a performer, who turns each phrase, every deeply felt sound into an event of his own inner monologue…with such consciously developed nuances, sensitivity, such 
concentration in combination with the feeling of drama…” (Marina Borisova, Daily 
Telegraph, No.91, Moscow, Russian Federation. May 20, 2008).
This season brought Sergey to Switzerland, Russia, Hungary and back to the U.S. 
to perform Tchaikovsky’s Rococo Variations with the Burlington Chamber Orchestra in 
the Lane series in Vermont and Longy Chamber Orchestra in Cambridge, Mass. In 
January 2009, Sergey has opened a new music series in Boston called “Great Russian 
Years” dedicated to the Great Russian composers. In Spring 2009 he is scheduled to 
perform extensively in Russia (January, February, March, April), Spain (March), Italy, Sweden (April), and Serbia (May) with summer engagements in the United States  at Newport and New Hampshire music festivals in July.
Sergey Antonov was born in 1983 into a family of cellists. His parents guided his 
first years, especially his mother, Maria Zhuravleva, a leading cello pedagogue at the prestigious Central Music School at the Moscow Conservatory. His late father, Boris, was a gifted cellist and a member of the Bolshoi Symphony Orchestra. He graduated from the Moscow Conservatory where he studied with Natalia Schakhovskaya and chamber music with Alexander Bonduryansky. Presently Sergey is an Artist Diploma 
candidate working with the Grammy nominated cellist Terry King at the Longy School 
of Music.
Sergey won top prizes in the Dotzauer and David Popper Competitions, was 
named “Favorite Artist in the Cello Division” at the Tchaikovsky Competition by Toyota Corp., as well as a recipient of the “2008 Golden Talent Award “ by the Russian Performing Art Foundation.  He has triumphed in many other competitions including first prizes at the Swedish Duo Competition, the International Chamber Music Competition of the Chamber Music Foundation of New England and the National ASTA Competition in Detroit (2007).
A great influence on the cellist was his work with the late Mstislav Rostropovich. 
Sergey was a frequent participant in his master classes at the Moscow Conservatory, 
which led to the maestro's invitation to join him on tours of Europe and Russia. He has collaborated with such artists as Yuri Bashmet, Yuri Simonov, Justus Franz, Dora 
Schwartzberg, Vadim Rudenko, Bernadene Blaha, John Lenehan. Spring 2009 will 
bring new collaborations with Maxim Vengerov, David Geringas, Eugene Bushkov and 
Mikhail Pletnev.
“There are few musicians this talented, with this esoteric ability, being able to 
touch the listener so deeply and put them in another dimension. Sergey Antonov is 
playing with intuition, he breathes and lives in music; the instrument is a natural 
extension of him.” (Sven Bertilsson, Katrineholm Kuriren, Sweden. July 2008) 
“…this musician has a serious artistic future.” (Marina Borisova, Daily Telegraph, No.91, Moscow, Russian Federation. May 20, 2008).

Ken started his referee career when he was studying in Canada. He started refereeing in Hong Kong in 1981. He was also being nominated as a FIFA referee.
In November 1990, Ng, in his individual name, wrote a letter to impeach the internal affairs of the Hong Kong Football Association. He then received a three-month ban and his name was removed from the FIFA referee list. Two referees thought that the punishment was too severe and applied to the High Court for an injunction. The HKFA and the referees then accepted reconciliation and retired as a referee in 1992.
In 1994, Ken was invited to manage Kitchee. Although the club were relegated that season, he was invited to manage Instant-Dict football club by Tam Wai Tong because of his good management.
Ken Ng became the general manager of Kitchee in 2000 and under this stewardship, the club was promoted to First Division in 2003.

== History ==
John Thompson, James Crosby, and J.P. Dickinson formed a partnership to establish a town, a mill, and other business ventures along the Turkey River at a place known as Hastings Bottom.  The new town was named Motor.  They spent $50,000 constructing the mill and $40,000 on equipment and other buildings.  Stone for these structures was quarried from the bluff above and it was lowered in cable cars that ran on wooden rails. 
Skilled German stonemasons from nearby Communia were hired to construct the 90-foot (27 m) tall, six-story gristmill.  Legend has it that there were four of them and each worked on a different wall.  Each tried to outdo the others in order to display his own craftsmanship, which is why three walls are composed of rounded stone while the fourth wall was laid with square cut stone.  The stone faces on the north side are flat because the investors intended to build a woolen mill there, but they could not find investors to build it.  
The mill was completed in 1869, and it was operational by the following year.  The mill ground barley, oats and rye for livestock feed; wheat and buckwheat into flour; and corn into cornmeal.  Barrels were made in the nearby cooperage to ship the flour and corn meal.  But the mill couldn't overcome difficulties beyond its control.  Chinch bugs destroyed area wheat crops and all the mills in the area competed for fewer raw materials.  A narrow-gauge railroad planned to serve the community was washed out, and a flood in 1883 washed out the dam.  The mill's investors never recouped what they put into it, and the partnership dissolved.  The district court auctioned the property in 1891. Louis Klink bought the townsite in 1903. He sold the mill's machinery and he used the buildings for his farm operation. The property remained in the family for 80 years. The Clayton County Conservation Board acquired the property in 1983 and converted into a park.

L-arabinose operon,"['Articles with short description', 'Gene expression', 'Operons', 'Short description matches Wikidata']","The L-arabinose operon, also called the ara or araBAD operon, is an operon required for the breakdown of the five-carbon sugar L-arabinose in Escherichia coli. The L-arabinose operon contains three structural genes: araB, araA, araD (collectively known as araBAD), which encode for three metabolic enzymes that are required for the metabolism of L-arabinose. AraB (ribulokinase), AraA (an isomerase), AraD (an epimerase) produced by these genes catalyse conversion of L-arabinose to an intermediate of the pentose phosphate pathway, D-xylulose-5-phosphate.The structural genes of the L-arabinose operon are transcribed from a common promoter into a single transcript, a mRNA. The expression of the L-arabinose operon is controlled as a single unit by the product of regulatory gene araC and the catabolite activator protein (CAP)-cAMP complex.  The regulator protein AraC is sensitive to the level of arabinose and plays a dual role as both an activator in the presence of arabinose and a repressor in the absence of arabinose to regulate the expression of araBAD. AraC protein not only controls the expression of araBAD but also auto-regulates its own expression at high AraC levels.","The L-arabinose operon, also called the ara or araBAD operon, is an operon required for the breakdown of the five-carbon sugar L-arabinose in Escherichia coli. The L-arabinose operon contains three structural genes: araB, araA, araD (collectively known as araBAD), which encode for three metabolic enzymes that are required for the metabolism of L-arabinose. AraB (ribulokinase), AraA (an isomerase), AraD (an epimerase) produced by these genes catalyse conversion of L-arabinose to an intermediate of the pentose phosphate pathway, D-xylulose-5-phosphate.The structural genes of the L-arabinose operon are transcribed from a common promoter into a single transcript, a mRNA. The expression of the L-arabinose operon is controlled as a single unit by the product of regulatory gene araC and the catabolite activator protein (CAP)-cAMP complex.  The regulator protein AraC is sensitive to the level of arabinose and plays a dual role as both an activator in the presence of arabinose and a repressor in the absence of arabinose to regulate the expression of araBAD. AraC protein not only controls the expression of araBAD but also auto-regulates its own expression at high AraC levels.


== Structure ==
L-arabinose operon is composed of structural genes and regulatory regions including the operator region (araO1, araO2) and the initiator region (araI1, araI2). The structural genes, araB, araA and araD, encode enzymes for L-arabinose catabolism. There is also a CAP binding site where CAP-cAMP complex binds to and facilitates catabolite repression, and results in positive regulation of araBAD when the cell is starved of glucose.

The regulatory gene, araC, is located upstream of the L-arabinose operon and encodes the arabinose-responsive regulatory protein AraC. Both araC and araBAD have a discrete promoter where RNA polymerase binds and initiates transcription. araBAD and araC are transcribed in opposite directions from the araBAD promoter (PBAD) and araC promoter (PC) respectively.


== Function ==
araA encodes L-arabinose isomerase, which catalyses isomerization between L-arabinose and L-ribulose.
araB encodes ribulokinase, which catalyses phosphorylation of L-ribulose to form L-ribulose-5-phosphate.
araD encodes  L-ribulose-5-phosphate 4-epimerase, which catalyses epimerization between L-ribulose 5-phosphate and D-xylulose-5-phosphate.
Both L-ribulose 5-phosphate and D-xylulose-5-phosphate are metabolites of the pentose phosphate pathway, which links the metabolism of 5-carbon sugars to that of 6-carbon sugars.


== Regulation ==

The L-arabinose system is not only under the control of CAP-cAMP activator, but also positively or negatively regulated through binding of AraC protein. AraC functions as a homodimer, which can control transcription of araBAD through interaction with the operator and the initiator region on L-arabinose operon. Each AraC monomer is composed of two domains including a DNA binding domain and a dimerisation domain. The dimerisation domain is responsible for arabinose-binding.
AraC undergoes conformational change upon arabinose-binding, in which, it has two distinct conformations. The conformation is purely determined by the binding of allosteric inducer arabinose.AraC can also negatively autoregulate its own expression when the concentration of AraC becomes too high. AraC synthesis is repressed through binding of dimeric AraC to the operator region (araO1).


=== Negative regulation of araBAD ===

When arabinose is absent, cells do not need the araBAD products for breaking down arabinose. Therefore, dimeric AraC acts as a repressor: one monomer binds to the operator of the araBAD gene (araO2), another monomer binds to a distant DNA half site known as araI1. This leads to the formation of a DNA loop. This orientation blocks RNA polymerase from binding to the araBAD promoter. Therefore, transcription of structural gene araBAD is inhibited.


=== Positive regulation of araBAD ===

Expression of the araBAD operon is activated in the absence of glucose and in the presence of arabinose. When arabinose is present, both AraC and CAP work together and function as activators.


==== Via AraC ====
AraC acts as an activator in the presence of arabinose.  AraC undergoes a conformational change when arabinose binds to the dimerization domain of AraC. As a result, the AraC-arabinose complex falls off from araO2 and breaks the DNA loop. Hence, it is more energetically favourable for AraC-arabinose to bind to two adjacent DNA half sites: araI1 and araI2 in the presence of arabinose. One of the monomers binds araI1, the remaining monomer binds araI2 - in other words, binding of AraC to araI2 is allosterically induced by arabinose. One of the AraC monomers places near to the araBAD promoter in this configuration, which helps to recruit RNA polymerase to the promoter to initiate transcription.


==== Via CAP/cAMP (catabolite repression) ====
CAP act as a transcriptional activator only in the absence of E. coli's preferred sugar, glucose. When glucose is absent, high level of CAP protein/cAMP complex bind to CAP binding site, a site between araI1 and araO1. Binding of CAP/cAMP is responsible for opening up the DNA loop between araI1 and araO2, increasing the binding affinity of AraC protein for araI2 and thereby promoting RNA polymerase to bind to araBAD promoter to switch on the expression of the araBAD required for metabolising L-arabinose.


=== Autoregulation of AraC ===
The expression of araC is negatively regulated by its own protein product, AraC. The excess AraC binds to the operator of the araC gene, araO1, at high AraC levels, which physically blocks the RNA polymerase from accessing the araC promoter. Therefore, the AraC protein inhibits its own expression at high concentrations.


== Use in protein expression system ==
The L-arabinose operon has been a focus for research in molecular biology since 1970, and has been investigated extensively at its genetic, biochemical, physiological and biotechnical levels. The L-arabinose operon has been commonly used in protein expression system, as the araBAD promoter can be used for producing targeted expression under tight regulation. By fusing the araBAD promoter to a gene of interest, the expression of the target gene can be solely regulated by arabinose: for example, the pGLO plasmid contains a green fluorescent protein gene under the control of the PBAD promoter, allowing GFP production to be induced by arabinose.

Dealkalization of water,"['Articles with short description', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'Water treatment']","The dealkalization of water refers to the removal of alkalinity ions from water. Chloride cycle anion ion-exchange dealkalizers remove alkalinity from water.
Chloride cycle dealkalizers operate similar to sodium cycle cation water softeners.

== Purpose ==
Dealkalizers are most often used as pre-treatment to a boiler and are usually preceded by a water softener.  Alkalinity is a factor that most often dictates the amount of boiler blowdown.  High alkalinity promotes boiler foaming and carryover and causes high amounts of boiler blowoff.  When alkalinity is the limiting factor affecting the amount of blowdown, a dealkalizer will increase the cycles of concentrations and reduce blowdown and operating costs.
The reduction of blowdown by dealkalization keeps the water treatment chemicals in the boiler longer, thus minimizing the amount of chemicals required for efficient, noncorrosive operation.Carbonate and bicarbonate alkalinities are decomposed by heat in boiler water releasing carbon dioxide into the steam.  This gas combines with the condensed steam in process equipment and return lines to form carbonic acid.  This depresses the pH value of the condensate returns and results in corrosive attack on the equipment and piping.
In general, a dealkalizer is best applied to boilers operating below 700 psi (48 bar).  In order to justify installation of a dealkalizer on low-pressure boilers, the alkalinity content should be above 50 ppm with the amount of make-up water exceeding 1,000 gallons (approx. 4,000 litres)  per day.
Cooling system make-up will also benefit from reduced alkalinity.  The addition of a dealkalizer to a cooling water system will substantially reduce the amount of acid required to treat the same amount of water.


== Alternate method ==
Hydrogen cycle weak acid cation resins convert alkalinity into carbon dioxide while removing calcium and magnesium. The resin is regenerated with acids at levels close to stoichiometric requirements.

== Early life ==
Born in South Bend, Indiana, he attended John Carroll Catholic High School in Birmingham, Alabama before attending the University of Notre Dame for his undergraduate studies (B.S., biology), and Yale University (Ph.D., biology) for his graduate work.


== Scientific career ==

In 1978, he moved to his first independent job, at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg, Germany and moved from Heidelberg to Princeton University in the United States in 1981.Much of his research has focused on embryogenesis in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, specifically in the patterning that occurs in the early Drosophila embryo. Most of the gene products used by the embryo at these stages are already present in the unfertilized egg and were produced by maternal transcription during oogenesis. A small number of gene products, however, are supplied by transcription in the embryo itself. He has focused on these ""zygotically"" active genes because he believes the temporal and spatial pattern of their transcription may provide the triggers controlling the normal sequence of embryonic development. Saturation of all the possible mutations on each chromosome by random events to test embryonic lethality was done by Eric Wieschaus. This body of science eventually was termed the Heidelberg screen.In 1995, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Edward B. Lewis and Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard as co-recipients, for their work revealing the genetic control of embryonic development.As of 2018, Wieschaus is the Squibb Professor in Molecular Biology at Princeton. He was formerly Adjunct Professor of Biochemistry at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey – Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.


== Personal life ==
He has three daughters and is married to molecular biologist Gertrud Schüpbach, who is also a professor of Molecular Biology at Princeton University, working on Drosophila oogenesis.Wieschaus is an atheist and is one of the 77 Nobel Laureates who signed the 2007 petition to repeal the Louisiana Science Education Act.

Springfield outlined: ""this is a disgraceful attempt to 'sell out' disabled people to commercial entities. Every day should be an accessible shopping day! Disability Labour are deeply concerned that the DWP, which harasses and persecutes disabled people on a daily basis, will use video footage to identify if claimants are shopping, what they’re purchasing and even how far they are walking"".

He was titular Duke of Opava and canon of Wrocław, Olomouc and Vienna, as well as Provost of the St. Othmar parish in Mödling.  In the older literature Przemko III is often confused with his uncle Przemko II.


== Life ==
His parents were Duke William of Opava and Salome, a daughter of the Bohemian nobleman Půta III of Častolovice.
After his father's death in 1452, his brother Ernest took up the guardianship of Przemko and his four siblings.  Przemko III and his brothers Frederick and Wenceslas III inherited a two thirds share of the Duchy of Opava; their cousin john II held the remaining third.  Their father had held the Duchy of Münsterberg for a while, however, Przemko and his brothers did not inherit it, because their father had swapped it with Ernest for the latter's third of Opava.  The brothers nevertheless sometimes used the title of ""Duke of Münsterberg"".  Ernest, in his capacity as their guardian, sold the brothers' two-thirds of Opava in 1464 to Duke Bolko V of Opole.  John II retained his share.
As Przemko III had no prospect of a steady income, his uncle destined him for a career in the clergy.  In 1464, he enrolled at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków under the name Preclarus princeps Przyemislaus dux Oppawie d. T..  He became a member of the Cathedral chapter in Wrocław, together with his uncle Przemko II, Duke of Opava (dux junior and dux senior).  The archives of Wrocław describe him as ""Duke of Münsterberg"" in 1466.  He also became canon of Olomouc, probably around the same time.
During the winter semester of 1471, Przemko III studied at the University of Vienna, where he probably received his bachelor's degree.  In 1479, he succeeded Paul Laubmann and Cathedral Dean in Vienna.  In the certificate of his appointment, he is called Primislaus dux Oppaue.  He also succeeded Paul Laubmann as provost of the St. Othmar parish in Mödling.  He received this appointment from Emperor Frederick III, together with an apartment at the ducal court, where he lived for the rest of his life.  His coat of arms can still be seen in this apartment.  He appears to have taken his job as pastor very seriously.  In the episcopal archive in Vienna, several documents from the years 1481-1484 describe his work. Although he had been financially ruined by the destruction in the Duchy of Opava, his university degree made him one of the more outstanding and accomplished Moravian and Silesian noblemen of his time.
Przemko II died unmarried and childless on 17 February 1493.  He was buried in the St. Othmar church in Mödling.  A red marble grave plate can still be found on the northern wall.  It bears the inscription: Anno Domini 1493. 17. februarii obiit hic illustris princeps Primislaus Opavie dux. Wratislaviensi Olemucensis et Wiennensis. Ecclesiarum canonicus plebanus hic in Medling atque decanus Wienne Austrie, cuius anima vivat Deo. Amen.

It is one of the famous landmarks of Vrnjačka Banja, and it is the best known among the town's 15 bridges.


== History ==

The history of love padlocks on this bridge dates back at least 100 years. Local schoolmistress Nada fell in love with a Serbian officer named Relja. After they committed to each other, Relja went to war in Greece, where, after the collapse of the Serbian Front as a result of the Austro-Hungarian attack of the 6 October 1915, he fell in love with a local woman from Corfu. As a consequence, Relja and Nada broke up their engagement.Nada never recovered from that devastating blow, and after some time, she died, as a result of her unfortunate love. As young girls from Vrnjačka Banja wanted to protect their own loves, they started writing down their names together with the names of their loved ones on padlocks. They bound these to the railings of the bridge where Nada and Relja used to meet. However, the tradition died out with time. It was not until Serbian writer and poet Desanka Maksimović wrote down a poem called A Prayer for Love, (Serbian: Molitva za ljubav) that the legend regained popularity. People started once again to bind their love with so-called ""love padlocks"" to the bridge. Consequently, it acquired the name Bridge of Love. After people bind their love with a padlock to the railing, the keys should be thrown down into the river below, so they cannot be found ever again.Another bridge in Serbia is also known by the name ""Bridge of Love"". It is the White Bridge in Vranje, which was built in the name of an unfulfilled tragic love.

His rule was marked by the Tver Uprising in 1327. Aleksandr Mikhailovich was executed in the Golden Horde together with his son Fyodor.


== Life ==
Aleksandr was a second son of Prince Mikhail of Tver by his wife, Anna of Kashin. As a young man, his appanages included Kholm and Mikulin. In 1322, he continued the Tver princes' opposition to the rise of Moscow when he rather spectacularly waylaid Grand Prince Yury of Moscow (who had schemed against Aleksandr's father to gain the yarlyk or patent of office from the khan of the Golden Horde, the Mongol kingdom which ruled Russia and much of central Asia in the 13th and 14th centuries) as Yury journeyed with the tribute from Novgorod to Moscow.Four years later, Aleksandr succeeded his childless brother Dmitry the Terrible Eyes who had been executed on behest of Uzbeg Khan in the Horde after Dmitry avenged his father's death by murdering Yury.

In 1327, a Tatar official, the baskak Shevkal (the cousin of Uzbeg), arrived in Tver from the Horde, with a large retinue. They took up residence at Aleksandr's palace and, according to chronicle reports, started terrorizing the city, randomly robbing and killing. Rumors spread that Shevkal wanted to kill the prince, occupy the throne for himself and introduce Islam to the city. When, on 15 August 1327, the Tatars tried to take a horse from a deacon named Dyudko, he cried for help and a mob of furious people rushed on the Tatars and killed them all. Shevkal and his remaining guards were burnt alive in one of the houses where they had attempted to hide.The massacre led inevitably to Tatar reprisals. Indeed, the whole incident may have been a provocation by the Tatars to destroy Aleksandr and the Tver princes.  Ivan Kalita of Moscow, brother of Yury of Moscow who had been murdered by Dmitri the Terrible Eyes in 1322, immediately went to the Horde and, before Aleksandr had time to justify himself to Uzbeg Khan, persuaded the khan to grant Moscow the yarlik or patent of office for the throne of Vladimir. The khan also sent Ivan at the head of an army of 50,000 soldiers to punish Tver. Alexander fled with his family to Novgorod, but he was not accepted there for fear of the Tatars, so he went on to Pskov.
Pskov not only allowed Aleksandr to enter their city, but made him their prince. Desiring to save the Russian land from further devastation — had Ivan Kalita left Aleksandr in Pskov, the Tatars would have certainly sent another punitive expedition which would have destroyed that city — Aleksandr agreed to abandon the city, but the residents of Pskov would not let him go. Metropolitan Feognost (Theognostus) arrived in Novgorod and he and Archbishop Moisei of Novgorod (1325–1330; 1352–1359) excommunicated the city at the behest of Ivan Kalita. In 1329, fulfilling the order of the khan, Ivan Kalita and many other princes declared war to Pskov. Aleksander fled into Lithuania and then to Sweden, after which the metropolitan lifted the ban of excommunication against Pskov. Aleksander returned to Pskov a year and a half later under the patronage of Gediminas, Grand Duke of Lithuania.
In 1335, Aleksandr sent his son, Fyodor, to the Horde in order to gain forgiveness. Two years later in 1337 he went there himself. Uzbeg Khan, at least for a time, forgave his old enemy and sent him back to Tver. This led to renewed hostilities with Moscow, which Tver' could not sustain.
On October 29, 1339, Aleksandr and Fyodor were quartered (chopped into four pieces) in Sarai, the capital city of the Horde, by the orders of Uzbeg Khan.


== Family ==
Alexander was married ca. 1320 to Anastasia of Halych and had eight children:

Fyodor of Tver (died 1339)
Lev (born 1321, date of death unknown)
Mikhail II of Tver (1333–1399)
Vsevolod of Kholm (died 1364)
Andrey (died 1365)
Vladimir (died 1365)
Maria (died 1399), married to Simeon of Russia
Uliana (ca. 1325–1392), married to Algirdas

== Band history ==
At a music festival at Nantes, France in 1998, percussionist Gunter Muller and turntablist Erikm were scheduled to perform as a duo. The same festival featured a performance by duo Voice Crack. The four musicians made an unscheduled collaboration, and afterwards formed a semi-regular quartet.
They recorded several albums and made a number of live appearances before disbanding. poire_z often invited a fifth musician as a guest: Keith Rowe, Phil Minton, Christian Marclay, Otomo Yoshihide, Sachiko M and others performed or recorded with the core quartet.
As with much free improvisation, poire_z's music is generally focused more on a group sound, and given the musicians' unorthodox approach to their instruments, it is often difficult to discern who is generating any individual sound. Aside from glimpses of Muller's occasionally unprocessed percussion, their music is nearly all electronic blips, clicks and droning like a shortwave radio tuned in to an extraterrestrial broadcast; critic Ed Howard described the group's music as ""all whir and purr and throb, the soldered electronic exclamations of the Voice Crack duo spurting around the steady rhythmic drive of Muller and eRikm ... a dense cycling drone with harsh electronic interjections skipping over the top."" One piece is described as ""delicate tones, crackles and light bubbling sounds, resting and intermingling with characteristic weightlessness, only occasionally being interrupted by glimpses of harsher textures.""Voice Crack formally disbanded in about 2004, and poire_z have not recorded or performed since.

As of 2021, the castle was operated as a family-run hotel with 24 rooms.


== History ==
Dornoch Castle was built around 1500 as the home of the bishops of Caithness. Bishop Robert Stewart gifted the castle to John Gordon, 11th Earl of Sutherland in 1557. In 1570 the castle was set alight in a feud between the McKays and Murrays. The rebuilding which followed included the addition of the upper part of the tower. The castle decayed during the 18th century, but was restored in 1813–1814 to serve as a school and jail. In 1859-60 it became a court house, and was made the headquarters of the Sheriff of Sutherland with extensive remodelling by William Fowler.Further alterations were made around 1880, including the heightening of the south-west block, and the addition of a three-storey east tower. Following the restoration the castle became a hunting lodge for visiting sportsmen. In 1947 it became a hotel. The Dornoch Castle Hotel has 24 rooms, including suites, and garden rooms, which were built in the 1970s. In addition, there are several personalized rooms and a restaurant. The castle is a category B listed building.
The Castle is believed to have been haunted by the ghost of  Andrew McCornish who was hanged for sheep stealing.The building passed into private hands in 1922, and became a hotel in 1947. It is now the Dornoch Castle Hotel.

Thyrotoxicosis is the condition that occurs due to excessive thyroid hormone of any cause and therefore includes hyperthyroidism.  It is noted that thyrotoxicosis is related to hyper-kinetic movement disorders including chorea and myoclonus. Some, however, use the terms interchangeably. Signs and symptoms vary between people and may include irritability, muscle weakness, sleeping problems, a fast heartbeat, heat intolerance, diarrhea, enlargement of the thyroid, hand tremor, and weight loss. Symptoms are typically less severe in the elderly and during pregnancy.

== Signs and symptoms ==

Hyperthyroidism may be asymptomatic or present with significant symptoms. Some of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism include nervousness, irritability, increased perspiration, heart racing, hand tremors, anxiety, trouble sleeping, thinning of the skin, fine brittle hair, and muscular weakness—especially in the upper arms and thighs. More frequent bowel movements may occur, and diarrhea is common. Weight loss, sometimes significant, may occur despite a good appetite (though 10% of people with a hyperactive thyroid experience weight gain), vomiting may occur, and, for women, menstrual flow may lighten and menstrual periods may occur less often, or with longer cycles than usual.Thyroid hormone is critical to normal function of cells. In excess, it both overstimulates metabolism and disrupts the normal functioning of sympathetic nervous system, causing ""speeding up"" of various body systems and symptoms resembling an overdose of epinephrine (adrenaline). These include fast heartbeat and symptoms of palpitations, nervous system tremor such as of the hands and anxiety symptoms, digestive system hypermotility, unintended weight loss, and, in lipid panel blood tests, a lower and sometimes unusually low serum cholesterol.Major clinical signs of hyperthyroidism include weight loss (often accompanied by an increased appetite), anxiety, heat intolerance, hair loss (especially of the outer third of the eyebrows), muscle aches, weakness, fatigue, hyperactivity, irritability, high blood sugar, excessive urination, excessive thirst, delirium, tremor, pretibial myxedema (in Graves' disease), emotional lability, and sweating.  Panic attacks, inability to concentrate, and memory problems may also occur. Psychosis and paranoia, common during thyroid storm, are rare with milder hyperthyroidism. Many persons will experience complete remission of symptoms 1 to 2 months after a euthyroid state is obtained, with a marked reduction in anxiety, sense of exhaustion, irritability, and depression. Some individuals may have an increased rate of anxiety or persistence of affective and cognitive symptoms for several months to up to 10 years after a euthyroid state is established. In addition, those with hyperthyroidism may present with a variety of physical symptoms such as palpitations and abnormal heart rhythms (the notable ones being atrial fibrillation), shortness of breath (dyspnea), loss of libido, amenorrhea, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, gynecomastia and feminization. Long term untreated hyperthyroidism can lead to osteoporosis. These classical symptoms may not be present often in the elderly.Neurological manifestations can include tremors, chorea, myopathy, and in some susceptible individuals (in particular of Asian descent) periodic paralysis. An association between thyroid disease and myasthenia gravis has been recognized. Thyroid disease, in this condition, is autoimmune in nature and approximately 5% of people with myasthenia gravis also have hyperthyroidism. Myasthenia gravis rarely improves after thyroid treatment and the relationship between the two entities is not well understood.In Graves' disease, ophthalmopathy may cause the eyes to look enlarged because the eye muscles swell and push the eye forward. Sometimes, one or both eyes may bulge. Some have swelling of the front of the neck from an enlarged thyroid gland (a goiter).Minor ocular (eye) signs, which may be present in any type of hyperthyroidism, are eyelid retraction (""stare""), extraocular muscle weakness, and lid-lag. In hyperthyroid stare (Dalrymple sign) the eyelids are retracted upward more than normal (the normal position is at the superior corneoscleral limbus, where the ""white"" of the eye begins at the upper border of the iris). Extraocular muscle weakness may present with double vision. In lid-lag (von Graefe's sign), when the person tracks an object downward with their eyes, the eyelid fails to follow the downward moving iris, and the same type of upper globe exposure which is seen with lid retraction occurs, temporarily. These signs disappear with treatment of the hyperthyroidism.Neither of these ocular signs should be confused with exophthalmos (protrusion of the eyeball), which occurs specifically and uniquely in hyperthyroidism caused by Graves' disease (note that not all exophthalmos is caused by Graves' disease, but when present with hyperthyroidism is diagnostic of Graves' disease). This forward protrusion of the eyes is due to immune-mediated inflammation in the retro-orbital (eye socket) fat. Exophthalmos, when present, may exacerbate hyperthyroid lid-lag and stare.


=== Thyroid storm ===

Thyroid storm is a severe form of thyrotoxicosis characterized by rapid and often irregular heart beat, high temperature, vomiting, diarrhea, and mental agitation. Symptoms may not be typical in the young, old, or pregnant. It usually occurs due to untreated hyperthyroidism and can be provoked by infections. It is a medical emergency and requires hospital care to control the symptoms rapidly. Even with treatment, death occurs in 20% to 50%.


=== Hypothyroidism ===
Hyperthyroidism due to certain types of thyroiditis can eventually lead to hypothyroidism (a lack of thyroid hormone), as the thyroid gland is damaged. Also, radioiodine treatment of Graves' disease often eventually leads to hypothyroidism. Such hypothyroidism may be diagnosed with thyroid hormone testing and treated by oral thyroid hormone supplementation.


== Causes ==

There are several causes of hyperthyroidism. Most often, the entire gland is overproducing thyroid hormone. Less commonly, a single nodule is responsible for the excess hormone secretion, called a ""hot"" nodule. Thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid) can also cause hyperthyroidism. Functional thyroid tissue producing an excess of thyroid hormone occurs in a number of clinical conditions.
The major causes in humans are:

Graves' disease. An autoimmune disease (usually, the most common cause with 50–80% worldwide, although this varies substantially with location- i.e., 47% in Switzerland (Horst et al., 1987) to 90% in the USA (Hamburger et al. 1981)). Thought to be due to varying levels of iodine in the diet. It is eight times more common in females than males and often occurs in young females, around 20 – 40 years of age.
Toxic thyroid adenoma (the most common cause in Switzerland, 53%, thought to be atypical due to a low level of dietary iodine in this country)
Toxic multinodular goiterHigh blood levels of thyroid hormones (most accurately termed hyperthyroxinemia) can occur for a number of other reasons:

Inflammation of the thyroid is called thyroiditis. There are several different kinds of thyroiditis including Hashimoto's thyroiditis (Hypothyroidism immune-mediated), and subacute thyroiditis (de Quervain's). These may be initially associated with secretion of excess thyroid hormone but usually progress to gland dysfunction and, thus, to hormone deficiency and hypothyroidism.
Oral consumption of excess thyroid hormone tablets is possible (surreptitious use of thyroid hormone), as is the rare event of eating ground beef or pork contaminated with thyroid tissue, and thus thyroid hormones (termed hamburger thyrotoxicosis or alimentary thyrotoxicosis). Pharmacy compounding errors may also be a cause.
Amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic drug, is structurally similar to thyroxine and may cause either under-or overactivity of the thyroid.
Postpartum thyroiditis (PPT) occurs in about 7% of women during the year after they give birth. PPT typically has several phases, the first of which is hyperthyroidism. This form of hyperthyroidism usually corrects itself within weeks or months without the need for treatment.
A struma ovarii is a rare form of monodermal teratoma that contains mostly thyroid tissue, which leads to hyperthyroidism.
Excess iodine consumption notably from algae such as kelp.Thyrotoxicosis can also occur after taking too much thyroid hormone in the form of supplements, such as levothyroxine (a phenomenon known as exogenous thyrotoxicosis, alimentary thyrotoxicosis, or occult factitial thyrotoxicosis).Hypersecretion of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which in turn is almost always caused by a pituitary adenoma, accounts for much less than 1 percent of hyperthyroidism cases.


== Diagnosis ==
Measuring the level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), produced by the pituitary gland (which in turn is also regulated by the hypothalamus's TSH Releasing Hormone) in the blood is typically the initial test for suspected hyperthyroidism. A low TSH level typically indicates that the pituitary gland is being inhibited or ""instructed"" by the brain to cut back on stimulating the thyroid gland, having sensed increased levels of T4 and/or T3 in the blood. In rare circumstances, a low TSH indicates primary failure of the pituitary, or temporary inhibition of the pituitary due to another illness (euthyroid sick syndrome) and so checking the T4 and T3 is still clinically useful.Measuring specific antibodies, such as anti-TSH-receptor antibodies in Graves' disease, or anti-thyroid peroxidase in Hashimoto's thyroiditis—a common cause of hypothyroidism—may also contribute to the diagnosis. The diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is confirmed by blood tests that show a decreased thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level and elevated T4 and T3 levels. TSH is a hormone made by the pituitary gland in the brain that tells the thyroid gland how much hormone to make. When there is too much thyroid hormone, the TSH will be low. A radioactive iodine uptake test and thyroid scan together characterizes or enables radiologists and doctors to determine the cause of hyperthyroidism. The uptake test uses radioactive iodine injected or taken orally on an empty stomach to measure the amount of iodine absorbed by the thyroid gland. Persons with hyperthyroidism absorb much more iodine than healthy persons which includes radioactive iodine which is easy to measure.  A thyroid scan producing images is typically conducted in connection with the uptake test to allow visual examination of the over-functioning gland.Thyroid scintigraphy is a useful test to characterize (distinguish between causes of) hyperthyroidism, and this entity from thyroiditis. This test procedure typically involves two tests performed in connection with each other: an iodine uptake test and a scan (imaging) with a gamma camera. The uptake test involves administering a dose of radioactive iodine (radioiodine), traditionally iodine-131 (131I), and more recently iodine-123 (123I). Iodine-123 may be the preferred radionuclide in some clinics due to its more favorable radiation dosimetry (i.e. less radiation dose to the person per unit administered radioactivity) and a gamma photon energy more amenable to imaging with the gamma camera. For the imaging scan, I-123 is considered an almost ideal isotope of iodine for imaging thyroid tissue and thyroid cancer metastasis.Typical administration involves a pill or liquid containing sodium iodide (NaI) taken orally, which contains a small amount of iodine-131, amounting to perhaps less than a grain of salt. A 2-hour fast of no food prior to and for 1 hour after ingesting the pill is required. This low dose of radioiodine is typically tolerated by individuals otherwise allergic to iodine (such as those unable to tolerate contrast mediums containing larger doses of iodine such as used in CT scan, intravenous pyelogram (IVP), and similar imaging diagnostic procedures). Excess radioiodine that does not get absorbed into the thyroid gland is eliminated by the body in urine. Some people with hyperthyroidism may experience a slight allergic reaction to the diagnostic radioiodine and may be given an antihistamine.The person returns 24 hours later to have the level of radioiodine ""uptake"" (absorbed by the thyroid gland) measured by a device with a metal bar placed against the neck, which measures the radioactivity emitting from the thyroid. This test takes about 4 minutes while the uptake % (i.e., percentage) is accumulated (calculated) by the machine software. A scan is also performed, wherein images (typically a center, left and right angle) are taken of the contrasted thyroid gland with a gamma camera; a radiologist will read and prepare a report indicating the uptake % and comments after examining the images. People with hyperthyroid will typically ""take up"" higher than normal levels of radioiodine. Normal ranges for RAI uptake are from 10 to 30%.
In addition to testing the TSH levels, many doctors test for T3, Free T3, T4, and/or Free T4 for more detailed results. Free T4 is unbound to any protein in the blood. Adult limits for these hormones are: TSH (units): 0.45 – 4.50 uIU/mL; T4 Free/Direct (nanograms): 0.82 – 1.77 ng/dl; and T3 (nanograms): 71 – 180 ng/dl. Persons with hyperthyroidism can easily exhibit levels many times these upper limits for T4 and/or T3. See a complete table of normal range limits for thyroid function at the thyroid gland article.
In hyperthyroidism CK-MB (Creatine kinase) is usually elevated.

		
		


=== Subclinical ===

In overt primary hyperthyroidism, TSH levels are low and T4 and T3 levels are high. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is a milder form of hyperthyroidism characterized by low or undetectable serum TSH level, but with a normal serum free thyroxine level. Although the evidence for doing so is not definitive, treatment of elderly persons having subclinical hyperthyroidism could reduce the number of cases of atrial fibrillation. There is also an increased risk of bone fractures (by 42%) in people with subclinical hyperthyroidism; there is insufficient evidence to say whether treatment with antithyroid medications would reduce that risk.


=== Screening ===
In those without symptoms who are not pregnant there is little evidence for or against screening.


== Treatment ==


=== Antithyroid drugs ===
Thyrostatics (antithyroid drugs) are drugs that inhibit the production of thyroid hormones, such as carbimazole (used in the UK) and methimazole (used in the US, Germany and Russia), and propylthiouracil. Thyrostatics are believed to work by inhibiting the iodination of thyroglobulin by thyroperoxidase and, thus, the formation of tetraiodothyronine (T4). Propylthiouracil also works outside the thyroid gland, preventing the conversion of (mostly inactive) T4 to the active form T3. Because thyroid tissue usually contains a substantial reserve of thyroid hormone, thyrostatics can take weeks to become effective and the dose often needs to be carefully titrated over a period of months, with regular doctor visits and blood tests to monitor results.A very high dose is often needed early in treatment, but, if too high a dose is used persistently, people can develop symptoms of hypothyroidism. This titrating of the dose is difficult to do accurately, and so sometimes a ""block and replace"" attitude is taken. In block and replace treatments thyrostatics are taken in sufficient quantities to completely block thyroid hormones, and the person treated as though they have complete hypothyroidism.


=== Beta-blockers ===
Many of the common symptoms of hyperthyroidism such as palpitations, trembling, and anxiety are mediated by increases in beta-adrenergic receptors on cell surfaces. Beta blockers, typically used to treat high blood pressure, are a class of drugs that offset this effect, reducing rapid pulse associated with the sensation of palpitations, and decreasing tremor and anxiety. Thus, a person suffering from hyperthyroidism can often obtain immediate temporary relief until the hyperthyroidism can be characterized with the Radioiodine test noted above and more permanent treatment take place. Note that these drugs do not treat hyperthyroidism or any of its long-term effects if left untreated, but, rather, they treat or reduce only symptoms of the condition.Some minimal effect on thyroid hormone production however also comes with propranolol—which has two roles in the treatment of hyperthyroidism, determined by the different isomers of propranolol. L-propranolol causes beta-blockade, thus treating the symptoms associated with hyperthyroidism such as tremor, palpitations, anxiety, and heat intolerance. D-propranolol inhibits thyroxine deiodinase, thereby blocking the conversion of T4 to T3, providing some though minimal therapeutic effect. Other beta-blockers are used to treat only the symptoms associated with hyperthyroidism. Propranolol in the UK, and metoprolol in the US, are most frequently used to augment treatment for people with hyperthyroid .


=== Diet ===
People with autoimmune hyperthyroidism (such as in Grave's disease) should not eat foods high in iodine, such as edible seaweed and kelps.From a public health perspective, the general introduction of iodized salt in the United States in 1924 resulted in lower disease, goiters, as well as improving the lives of children whose mothers would not have eaten enough iodine during pregnancy which would have lowered the IQs of their children.


=== Surgery ===
Surgery (thyroidectomy to remove the whole thyroid or a part of it) is not extensively used because most common forms of hyperthyroidism are quite effectively treated by the radioactive iodine method, and because there is a risk of also removing the parathyroid glands, and of cutting the recurrent laryngeal nerve, making swallowing difficult, and even simply generalized staphylococcal infection as with any major surgery. Some people with Graves' may opt for surgical intervention. This includes those that cannot tolerate medicines for one reason or another, people that are allergic to iodine, or people that refuse radioiodine.If people have toxic nodules treatments typically include either removal or injection of the nodule with alcohol.


=== Radioiodine ===
In iodine-131 (radioiodine) radioisotope therapy, which was first pioneered by Dr. Saul Hertz, radioactive iodine-131 is given orally (either by pill or liquid) on a one-time basis, to severely restrict, or altogether destroy the function of a hyperactive thyroid gland. This isotope of radioactive iodine used for ablative treatment is more potent than diagnostic radioiodine (usually iodine-123 or a very low amount of iodine-131), which has a biological half-life from 8–13 hours. Iodine-131, which also emits beta particles that are far more damaging to tissues at short range, has a half-life of approximately 8 days.  People not responding sufficiently to the first dose are sometimes given an additional radioiodine treatment, at a larger dose. Iodine-131 in this treatment is picked up by the active cells in the thyroid and destroys them, rendering the thyroid gland mostly or completely inactive.Since iodine is picked up more readily (though not exclusively) by thyroid cells, and (more important) is picked up even more readily by over-active thyroid cells, the destruction is local, and there are no widespread side effects with this therapy. Radioiodine ablation has been used for over 50 years, and the only major reasons for not using it are pregnancy and breastfeeding (breast tissue also picks up and concentrates iodine). Once the thyroid function is reduced, replacement hormone therapy (levothyroxine) taken orally each day replaces the thyroid hormone that is normally produced by the body.There is extensive experience, over many years, of the use of radioiodine in the treatment of thyroid overactivity and this experience does not indicate any increased risk of thyroid cancer following treatment. However, a study from 2007 has reported an increased number of cancer cases after radioiodine treatment for hyperthyroidism.The principal advantage of radioiodine treatment for hyperthyroidism is that it tends to have a much higher success rate than medications. Depending on the dose of radioiodine chosen, and the disease under treatment (Graves' vs. toxic goiter, vs. hot nodule etc.), the success rate in achieving definitive resolution of the hyperthyroidism may vary from 75 to 100%. A major expected side-effect of radioiodine in people with Graves' disease is the development of lifelong hypothyroidism, requiring daily treatment with thyroid hormone. On occasion, some people may require more than one radioactive treatment, depending on the type of disease present, the size of the thyroid, and the initial dose administered.People with Graves' disease manifesting moderate or severe Graves' ophthalmopathy are cautioned against radioactive iodine-131 treatment, since it has been shown to exacerbate existing thyroid eye disease. People with mild or no ophthalmic symptoms can mitigate their risk with a concurrent six-week course of prednisone. The mechanisms proposed for this side effect involve a TSH receptor common to both thyrocytes and retro-orbital tissue.As radioactive iodine treatment results in the destruction of thyroid tissue, there is often a transient period of several days to weeks when the symptoms of hyperthyroidism may actually worsen following radioactive iodine therapy. In general, this happens as a result of thyroid hormones being released into the blood following the radioactive iodine-mediated destruction of thyroid cells that contain thyroid hormone. In some people, treatment with medications such as beta blockers (propranolol, atenolol, etc.) may be useful during this period of time. Most people do not experience any difficulty after the radioactive iodine treatment, usually given as a small pill. On occasion, neck tenderness or a sore throat may become apparent after a few days, if moderate inflammation in the thyroid develops and produces discomfort in the neck or throat area. This is usually transient, and not associated with a fever, etc.Women breastfeeding should discontinue breastfeeding for at least a week, and likely longer, following radioactive iodine treatment, as small amounts of radioactive iodine may be found in breast milk even several weeks after the radioactive iodine treatment.A common outcome following radioiodine is a swing from hyperthyroidism to the easily treatable hypothyroidism, which occurs in 78% of those treated for Graves' thyrotoxicosis and in 40% of those with toxic multinodular goiter or solitary toxic adenoma. Use of higher doses of radioiodine reduces the number of cases of treatment failure, with penalty for higher response to treatment consisting mostly of higher rates of eventual hypothyroidism which requires hormone treatment for life.There is increased sensitivity to radioiodine therapy in thyroids appearing on ultrasound scans as more uniform (hypoechogenic), due to densely packed large cells, with 81% later becoming hypothyroid, compared to just 37% in those with more normal scan appearances (normoechogenic).


=== Thyroid storm ===
Thyroid storm presents with extreme symptoms of hyperthyroidism.  It is treated aggressively with resuscitation measures along with a combination of the above modalities including: an intravenous beta blockers such as propranolol, followed by a thioamide such as methimazole, an iodinated radiocontrast agent or an iodine solution if the radiocontrast agent is not available, and an intravenous steroid such as hydrocortisone.


=== Alternative medicine ===
In countries such as China, herbs used alone or with antithyroid medications are used to treat hyperthyroidism. Very low quality evidence suggests that traditional Chinese herbal medications may be beneficial when taken along with routine hyperthyroid medications, however, there is no reliable evidence to determine the effectiveness of Chinese herbal medications for treating hyperthyroidism.


== Epidemiology ==
In the United States hyperthyroidism affects about 1.2% of the population. About half of these cases have obvious symptoms while the other half do not. It occurs between two and ten times more often in women. The disease is more common in those over the age of 60 years.Subclinical hyperthyroidism modestly increases the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia.

Caleb Hillier Parry first made the association between the goiter and protrusion of the eyes in 1786, however, did not publish his findings until 1825. In 1835, Irish doctor Robert James Graves discovered a link between the protrusion of the eyes and goiter, giving his name to the autoimmune disease now known as Graves' Disease.


== Pregnancy ==

Recognizing and evaluating hyperthyroidism in pregnancy is a diagnostic challenge. Thyroid hormones are naturally elevated during pregnancy and hyperthyroidism must also be distinguished from gestational transient thyrotoxicosis. Nonetheless, high maternal FT4 levels during pregnancy have been associated with impaired brain developmental outcomes of the offspring and this was independent of for example hCG levels.

=== Cats ===
Hyperthyroidism is one of the most common endocrine conditions affecting older domesticated housecats. In the United States, up to 10% of cats over ten years old have hyperthyroidism. The disease has become significantly more common since the first reports of feline hyperthyroidism in the 1970s. The most common cause of hyperthyroidism in cats is the presence of benign tumors called adenomas. 98% of cases are caused by the presence of an adenoma, but the reason these cats develop such tumors continues to be studied.
The most common presenting symptoms are: rapid weight loss, tachycardia (rapid heart rate), vomiting, diarrhea, increased consumption of fluids (polydipsia), increased appetite (polyphagia), and increased urine production (polyuria). Other symptoms include hyperactivity, possible aggression, an unkempt appearance, and large, thick claws. Heart murmurs and a gallop rhythm can develop due to secondary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  About 70% of afflicted cats also have enlarged thyroid glands (goiter). 10% of cats exhibit ""apathetic hyperthyroidism"", which is characterized by anorexia and lethargy.The same three treatments used with humans are also options in treating feline hyperthyroidism (surgery, radioiodine treatment, and anti-thyroid drugs). There is also a special low iodine diet available that will control the symptoms providing no other food is fed; Hill's y/d formula, when given exclusively, decreases T4 production by limiting the amount of iodine needed for thyroid hormone production. It is the only available commercial diet that focuses on managing feline hyperthyroidism. Medical and dietary management using methimazole and Hill's y/d cat food will give hyperthyroid cats an average of 2 years before dying due to secondary conditions such as heart and kidney failure. Drugs used to help manage the symptoms of hyperthyroidism are methimazole and carbimazole. Drug therapy is the least expensive option, even though the drug must be administered daily for the remainder of the cat's life. Carbimazole is only available as a once daily tablet. Methimazole is available as an oral solution, a tablet, and compounded as a topical gel that is applied using a finger cot to the hairless skin inside a cat's ear. Many cat owners find this gel a good option for cats that don't like being given pills.
Radioiodine treatment, however, is not available in all areas, as this treatment requires nuclear radiological expertise and facilities that not only board the cat, but are specially equipped to manage the cat's urine, sweat, saliva, and stool, which are radioactive for several days after the treatment, usually for a total of 3 weeks (the cat spends the first week in total isolation and the next two weeks in close confinement). In the United States, the guidelines for radiation levels vary from state to state; some states such as Massachusetts allow hospitalization for as little as two days before the animal is sent home with care instructions.


=== Dogs ===
Hyperthyroidism is much less common in dogs compared to cats. Hyperthyroidism may be caused by a thyroid tumor. This may be a thyroid carcinoma. About 90% of carcinomas are very aggressive; they invade the surrounding tissues and metastasize (spread) to other tissues, particularly the lungs. This has a poor prognosis. Surgery to remove the tumor is often very difficult due to metastasis into arteries, the esophagus, or the windpipe. It may be possible to reduce the size of the tumor, thus relieving symptoms and allowing time for other treatments to work. About 10% of thyroid tumors are benign; these often cause few symptoms.In dogs treated for hypothyroidism (lack of thyroid hormone), iatrogenic hyperthyroidism may occur as a result of an overdose of the thyroid hormone replacement medication, levothyroxine; in this case, treatment involves reducing the dose of levothyroxine. Dogs which display coprophagy, the consumption of feces, and also live in a household with a dog receiving levothyroxine treatment, may develop hyperthyroidism if they frequently eat the feces from the dog receiving levothyroxine treatment.Hyperthyroidism may occur if a dog eats an excessive amount of thyroid gland tissue. This has occurred in dogs fed commercial dog food.

== History ==


=== Early years ===
RAF Croughton was built in 1938, and was originally known as Brackley Landing Ground until 1940 when it became RAF Brackley. In July 1941 the name changed again and the station became RAF Croughton.It consisted of 694 acres (2.81 km2) consolidated from three farms.  Three grass runways with concrete taxiways dominated the high ground with the tower and other infrastructure buildings along the north side of the station and the slope leading up to the runways. In June 1940 the station became a satellite for RAF Upper Heyford for No. 16 Operational Training Unit (No. 16 OTU) to provide the unit with extra airfield space for night-flying training.Much of this training was for Commonwealth pilots (Canadians, South Africans, Australians, and New Zealanders) on Handley Page Hampdens, Bristol Blenheims, and Vickers Wellington bombers.  The unit fell under the operational control of the newly formed No. 7 Group RAF of RAF Bomber Command.


=== Second World War ===
In September 1940 the Air Ministry decided that certain stations would be designated as emergency airfields.  These stations would give assistance to any operational aircraft returning damaged or with engine problems.  The Station Commander at RAF Upper Heyford received one of these orders. RAF Brackley (Croughton) would remain open with its flare paths illuminated irrespective of enemy activity in the area.  This meant that RAF Brackley along with other emergency airfields attracted additional enemy night attacks.  Added to this accepted high risk was the fact that RAF Brackley was a training airfield.  During the war both sides considered it worthwhile to attack and disrupt training programmes.  Because training fields and aircraft were lightly defended, they made for easier targets.  For these reasons, it was not uncommon for the station or training crews conducting night training to receive the attention of the Luftwaffe.While the station remained a satellite for RAF Upper Heyford and No. 16 OTU until July 1942 and even partially re-equipped with Wellington bombers, its future had already changed. No. 23 Squadron of RAF Flying Training Command (FTC) was desperately seeking a suitable airfield to re-house its No. 1 Glider Training School (No. 1 GTS).Its then home was a small airfield at RAF Thame in Buckinghamshire and FTC felt it inadequate for glider training. Several airfields in the near vicinity made the short list, but RAF Croughton became the new home for the gliders.  On 19 July 1942, No. 1 GTS began to move in and by 1 August 1942 they were settled into their new home.  During this training Hawker Hectors, North American Harvards, and Miles Masters pulled General Aircraft Hotspur gliders, while Douglas Dakotas pulled the larger Airspeed Horsa gliders.With this new mission came a far stricter training regime and standards than that usually found at an RAF training station.  The reason for this was the dual roles required of the glider pilots.  They would receive twelve weeks of basic flying training, before moving to one of the GTS.  Training at the GTS took another twelve weeks.  From there they would move onto their operational units. In addition to flying the gliders, pilots had to be as highly trained and disciplined as infantry troops.  This way they could make a positive contribution to the battle after landing in the assault areas.  However, they would only remain in the assault area until their recovery.  By the end of 1942 the RAF thought it had enough trained glider pilots, at least for foreseeable operational need.  There was now a large number of trained glider pilots and this led to its own problems and another change in the station's mission.

As the last class passed out of RAF Croughton on 24 March 1943, the glider school closed down.  It continued to be a training base, but now it was a satellite for Kidlington in Oxfordshire where the No. 20 (Pilots) Advanced Flying Unit RAF (AFU) gave refresher or advanced training to pilots.  Established in 1942, the AFUs provided refresher courses to pilots trained overseas under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. It also gave newly qualified pilots experience with flying in British weather and handling heavier aircraft.  With the No. 20 AFU, this meant the Airspeed Oxford.  Pilots training with these aircraft knew they were destined for either Bomber or Coastal Command.On 15 April 1943 No. 1538 (Beam Approach Training) Flight RAF (No.15 BATF) formed at RAF Croughton and added to the station's training mission.  Before this many of the pilots training with No. 20 AFU received their Beam Approach Training at RAF Feltwell.  Both No. 1538 BATF and No. 20 AFU remained at RAF Croughton until 18 October 1944 when the airfield returned to Flying Training Command. On this date No. 1538 BATF disbanded and No. 20 AFU retired to Kidlington.RAF Flying Training Command needed the station to reform No. 1 Glider Training School.  The decision to reopen glider training came about when the army finally agreed that the glider pilots should be RAF.  From the beginning both the RAF and Army had differing opinions as to who should pilot the gliders. The Army felt the Glider Pilot Regiment was an elite force and that the pilots should be from the Army or at the very least trained to the same standard.  The Army even rejected a proposal from the RAF to have a RAF pilot sit in the second pilot or co-pilot seat. This changed after Operation Market Garden.

During the Arnhem portion of that operation 460 glider pilots were either killed or captured, with another 150 wounded.  The Army agreed to let the RAF help fill the vacancies in the Glider Pilot Regiment. Of the planned 1,000 trained glider pilot target figure, to be reached by April 1945, the RAF proposed to fill 500.  No. 1 GTS arrived at RAF Croughton on 1 November 1944. Training continued until after the war and even included the addition of a Glider Instructor Flight.During August 1945 No. 1 GTS came under the command of No. 21 Heavy Glider Conversion Unit RAF at RAF Brize Norton.  Flying and training ceased on 25 May 1946.  With No. 1 GTS leaving RAF Croughton, its remaining aircraft, Hotspurs and Masters worth preserving, moved to No. 3 GTS at RAF Wellesbourne Mountford.


=== Postwar – United States Air Force use ===

From 1947 to 1950 the Station remained fairly quiet and forgotten except for its occasional use as an ammunitions store.  That all changed towards the end of 1950 when the USAF took over the station when the 1969th Communications Squadron at RAF South Ruislip formed a detachment at RAF Croughton.  This began RAF Croughton's new communications mission.  Over the next several decades the units stationed at RAF Croughton changed many times, but the mission remained communications.In 1955 this detachment became the 1230th Airways and Air Communications Service Squadron (AACS).  As part of the establishment of the Air Force Communication Service as a separate major command, Air Force Communications Command, in 1961, the 1230 AACS redesignated to become the 2130th Communications Squadron (CS).  In just over ten years the mission and unit grew to the point that it needed to redesignate to the 2130th Communications Group (CG). By 1977, the 2130 CG controlled USAF communication resources from as far south as Cornwall, England and as far north as Keflavík, Iceland.

With the formation of the 2147th Communications Group at RAF Mildenhall and the realignment of many squadrons, detachments, and Operating Locations in 1980, the 2130 CG inactivated. Several communications missions at RAF Croughton, like the Defense Communications System, and Global Command and Control Radio System, combined with the responsibility for their maintenance falling on the 2168th Communications Squadron at RAF Upper Heyford.  This changed again with the reactivation of the 2130th Communications Squadron on 1 July 1983 to manage the communications missions at RAF Croughton.  The mission increased in December 1985 when the Giant Talk station at RAF Croughton began operations.  In 1988 the 2130 CS again redesignated to become the 2130th Communications Group.The beginning of 1993 saw several big changes for RAF Croughton.  Most of these had to do with mission support.  With the projected inactivation of the 20th Fighter Wing at RAF Upper Heyford and closure of that station the 2130 CG redesignated to the 630th Communications Squadron.  This new squadron functionally aligned under the 100th Communications Group (CG) at RAF Mildenhall.  However, this was no ordinary communications squadron.  Before the closure of RAF Upper Heyford, RAF Croughton had relied on the larger base for administrative support to one degree or another.  The closure of RAF Upper Heyford forced the squadron to look for ways to be as self-sufficient as possible.  To handle most day-to-day support functions, the squadron had its own finance, personnel, supply, and other support elements.  It became a mini-station.During this time RAF Croughton received most of its mission support from the 100 CG as well as some from the 100th Regional Support Group (RSG).  Both of these units resided at RAF Mildenhall under the 100th Air Refueling Wing (ARW).  This changed on 1 July 1994 when United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) conducted another command-wide reorganization.  One result of this reorganization was the inactivation of the 100 RSG, its subordinate squadrons and the 100 CG.  In their place, USAFE activated the 603rd Regional Support Group as an independent group directly under Third Air Force.  This in turn forced the redesignation of the 630 CS to the 603rd Communications Squadron.The end of 1995 saw USAFE clarifying the roles and missions of the numbered air forces.  This resulted in a change that led to the alignment of three UK and one Norway Geographically Separate Units (GSUs) under the 100 ARW. Third Air Force issued an order, effective 24 May 1996, assigning all personnel formally attached to the 603 RSG and its subordinates to the 100 ARW for administrative control.  For RAF Croughton this led to the inactivation of the 603 CS and the activation of the 422nd Air Base Squadron (422 ABS) on 1 August 1996.


=== 21st century ===

On 12 May 2005, the 422 ABG became a unit of the 501st Combat Support Wing (501 CSW) as part of an alignment of all major Geographically Separate Units (GSUs) in England.In 2012 a 2.5 gigabits per second data circuit was established to Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti, U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) only permanent military base in Africa.In November 2013 Tom Watson MP, was reported as saying that there was: ""an urgent need for ""public scrutiny"" of the activities at RAF Croughton.  The US Air Force station is a major hub for American military and clandestine communications"".  It is reported to have been central to the monitoring of the mobile phone of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel.In December 2013 The Independent reported that the base was used to relay U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency communications, and it was a key intelligence facility in the UK. In 2014 byelaws were enacted by statutory instrument prohibited various activities in and around the base.National Review (an American publication) refers in a July 2015 story to: 'the Joint Intelligence Analysis Center (JIAC), an ""intelligence fusion center"" that Congress approved for construction at UK airbase RAF Croughton. The facility would bring together intelligence analysts from U.S. European Command (EUCOM), AFRICOM, and NATO under one roof, fostering a level of collaboration military commanders say is crucial to confronting Russian aggression and Islamic fundamentalism in Africa'.In 2016 the United States Department of Defense announced that a £200 million Joint Intelligence Analysis Centre would be built at the base, to house up to 1,250 staff analyzing intelligence from Europe and Africa, some transferred from the Joint Analysis Center at RAF Molesworth. However an Office of the Inspector General investigation found that financial analysis leading to this decision was inaccurate.The 2017 Office of the Inspector General report recorded that the base provided command, control, communications, and computer support to Department of Defense and civilian agencies across Europe, and was staffed by about 265 U.S. military personnel, 140 Department of Defense civilians, and 200 UK Ministry of Defence employees. It provided about 25% of all European to United States military communications.In August 2019 Harry Dunn, a local teenager, was killed in a collision with a vehicle driven on the wrong side of the road by Anne Sacoolas, the wife of a US government employee working on the Royal Air Force station used by the United States Air Force. Friends of the victim gathered to demonstrate outside the base.On 9 July 2020 an adjournment debate on RAF Croughton, in the House of Commons, was led by local Member of Parliament Andrea Leadsom, who called for the expansion of the airbase to be stopped and for the base entrance to be moved to the A43 main road.On 22 March 2021 the 501 CSW announced that The United States Department of the Air Force completed its business case analysis and determined it was not cost effective to consolidate support facilitates at RAF Molesworth. Subsequently the U.S. Department of Defense submitted, and UK Ministry of Defence approved a request to allow RAF Alconbury to remain open, and to continue as the primary location for Joint Intelligence Analysis Center support.


== Role and operations ==
RAF Croughton houses the 422nd Air Base Group whose function is to provide installation support, services, force protection, and worldwide communications across the entire spectrum of operations.  The group is located in the UK and supports NATO, US European Command, US Central Command, Air Force Special Operations Command, US Department of State operations and Ministry of Defence operations.  The group sustains more than 410 C2 circuits and supports 25 percent of all European Theater to continental United States (CONUS) communications.

Second World,"['Articles with short description', 'Cold War terminology', 'Economic country classifications', 'Imperialism studies', 'Politics by region', 'Short description is different from Wikidata', 'Use dmy dates from June 2021']","The Second World is a term used during the Cold War for the industrial socialist states that were under the influence of the Soviet Union. In the first two decades following World War II, 19 communist states emerged; all of these were at least originally within the Soviet sphere of influence, though some (notably, Yugoslavia and the People's Republic of China) broke with Moscow and developed their own path of socialism  while retaining Communist governments.  Most communist states remained part of this bloc until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991; afterwards, only five (now four) Communist states remained: China, Cuba, Laos, North Korea and Vietnam. Along with ""First World"" and ""Third World"", the term was used to divide the states of Earth into three broad categories.","The Second World is a term used during the Cold War for the industrial socialist states that were under the influence of the Soviet Union.

Along with ""First World"" and ""Third World"", the term was used to divide the states of Earth into three broad categories.


== Concept ==
The concept of ""Second World"" was a construct of the Cold War and the term is still largely used to describe former communist countries that are between poverty and prosperity, many of which are now capitalist states, such as Eastern Europe. Subsequently, the actual meaning of the terms ""First World"", ""Second World,"" and ""Third World"" changed from being based on political ideology to an economic definition. The three-world theory has been criticized as crude and relatively outdated for its nominal ordering (1; 2; 3) and sociologists have instead used the words ""developed"", ""developing"", and ""underdeveloped"" as replacement terms for global stratification (which in turn have been criticized as displaying a colonialist mindset); nevertheless, the three-world theory is still popular in contemporary literature and media. This might also cause semantic variation of the term between describing a region's political entities and its people.


== Human development ==
The Three Worlds Model was used to rank the development of countries and their economies during the Cold War. First World countries were capitalist and industrial; they shared similar political and economic institutions, and retained influence over parts of the former colonial world. Second World countries advocated socialism and shared certain characteristics such as centrally planned economic systems, single-party states, and mainly medium income levels. The First World and the Second World were competing for political and economic influence over developing nations known as the Third World.
The Human Development Index is an index used to rank countries and is quantified by looking at a country's human development such as life expectancy, education, and per capita income indicators. The scale is 0-1 and they are put into one of four categories; 0-.55 is low, .55-.70 is medium, .70-.80 is high and very high tops out at .80-1.0.  The Second World countries from the Cold War era currently range from medium human development to very high human development in terms of HDI.


== Examples and decline in usage of term ==
Some examples of Cold-War definition Second World countries were Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Mongolia, North Korea, Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union, and the German Democratic Republic. In a socio-economic sense, similar to those assumed by the terms First and Third world in the post-Cold War environment, the clearest definition for the Second World would be newly industrialized countries such as Thailand, India, Malaysia, Philippines, Turkey, Mexico and Brazil. Second World countries are countries that are more stable and more developed than Third World countries which exist in parts of Africa, South and Central America and south Asia, but less stable and less developed than First World countries such as Norway. Developing countries are countries that are less industrialized and have lower per capita income levels.The powerful economies of the West are still sometimes described as “First World,” but the term “Second World” became largely obsolete following the collapse of the Soviet Union.

=== Early history ===
MCRH was founded by Priscilla Chism in 1974 just after the US Supreme Court's historic Roe v Wade decision.  The clinic was originally located in a building across the street from the Greyhound bus terminal in downtown Memphis. Many patients who came for services came from small towns throughout the Mid South by bus.
within 18 months a foundation loan allowed it to move to a remodeled former private home in Mid Town.  It was the first women's clinic in the Mid South, opening in January 1975.  In the early years following the Roe v. Wade decision there was prominent public support for the provision of quality abortion services.  It was viewed even in Tennessee as a matter of women's public health, and the staff of the center included graduate students, several on internships, from the University of Tennessee Center for the Health Sciences, the University of Memphis, and Rhodes College.  MCRH had a very prominent profile in the community, with an advisory committee of eminent leaders, professors, and officials.
Priscilla Chism developed a wide variety of public events and innovative programs, with official endorsement of the City of Memphis and the center was not controversial, nor did it experience picketing until years later, when anti-abortion forces emerged and organized.  The center was very actively called on by the media and had extensive speaking engagements and a high profile at public schools and universities on a wide variety of topics related to women's health and sexuality.
The most prominent program it developed beyond its core medical services, which were often staffed by OB-GYN residents from UTCHS, and which had prominent local gynecologists as medical directors, was the Memphis Sexual Assault Resources Center (now MSARC).  This pioneered nationally the creation of the role of the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE), whose role included on call 24/7 services for victims of sexual assault, crisis counseling, prophylactic care to avoid pregnancy and STDs, expert collection of forensic evidence, ready expert testimony in prosecutions, and ongoing counseling.  Priscilla Chism and Brenda A. Brown of the Memphis Police Department conceptualized and co authored, with the endorsement of Mayor Chandler and Gen. Jay Hubbard, Chief of Police, a grant which gained funding through DHEW, and its services continue to this day.  In its first year of services the rates of cases dropped for lack of prosecution declined by a whopping 60 percent.  The funding was obtained with the help of Senator Howard Baker, and the support of many prominent Memphians.


=== Post-2010 ===
In May 2010, Choices received a $150,000 grant from the MAC AIDS Fund, and expanded its services and moved to a new and more prominent location on Poplar Avenue in Memphis.  Previously called The Memphis Center for Reproductive Health, ""Choices"" was selected as an easier-to-remember title.  The clinic is now directed by Rebecca Terrell, who sees her work as ""an opportunity to make a difference in a field I thought was really important,"" and sees the new location as a place to help people achieve their reproductive health goals throughout the course of their lives ""without embarrassment.""


== Services and facilities ==
Choices provides surgical and medical abortions, STD and STI treatment and testing, counseling and advice for abortion and adoption, PAP smears, sex education, fertility services, miscarriage management, emergency contraception, and guidance through miscarriage and menopause.  Recently named a Ryan White provider, Choices also provides HIV/AIDS testing.  The clinic plans to add prenatal care and midwife delivery services in the next few years. All Choices services are confidential.


== Controversy and criticism ==
Along with other Tennessee reproductive healthcare facilities, Choices faces state plans for a 2014 vote over a constitutional amendment which would eliminate abortion in Tennessee.  Anti-abortion organizations such as the Family Action Council of Tennessee have accused Choices and other abortion providers of turning Tennessee into an ""abortion destination"" and continue to campaign for further restrictions on abortion procedures.Like many other abortion providers, Choices has experienced pro-life protestors at its doors, vandalism, and threats of violence; although visible opposition is currently limited to a few weekly protesters handing out leaflets and praying the rosary.  In 2009, shortly after the murder of George Tiller, a bomb threat brought the police to Choices, but no bomb was found on the premises.

== Personal life ==
He was born on 20 October 1942 in Pinnarawa village, Badulla as the youngest in a family with five siblings. He has three elder sisters and two elder brothers. His father was Romiel Perera and mother was Nanda Perera. When Hemapala was three years old, his parents admitted him to the primary section of the convent in the village with the intention of providing him with an education. He had been studying the alphabet for about a year, and had the opportunity to enter the first year at the age of four. At that time, the first children admitted to the first grade were given the required immunizations at school.Hemapala was also given the same immunizations on the day of the school holidays. Hemapala was poisoned by the vaccine and as a result, spots appeared all over his body. He was later admitted to the Badulla Hospital where he was treated for poisoning. The doctors decided to give 24 injections at the hospital. All wounds were cut with scissors. After about 12 injections, the flesh began to appear and cover in one eye. Chloroform was applied and three operations were performed on the eyes. But unfortunately the drug also poisoned his body and he lost his sight. At the age of nine, both eyes became blind. With a sudden illness, his education was disrupted.In 1975, Hemapala met his wife Kusuma Perera who is from Venivelkola village in Kahathuduwa. She was a fan of him where she sent letters to him. Later they met, got to know each other and got married in 1976. The couple has one daughter and one son.


== Career ==
Although there was no one involved in music at Hemapala's house, he realized that his elder brother had brought some musical instruments and was preparing to learn music. At that time, Hemapala was listening intently as his brother practiced music at night. Hemapala had the ability to play musical instruments such as the flute, mouth organ and the Japanese mandolin. It was his father who developed that self-taught knowledge and later made him a talented musician.At that time his elder brother was studying music with under J.M. Amaratunga, who was the son of Sadiris Master. His father brought Amaratunga home and taught classical music to Hemapala. He first learned the tabla from that teacher. He did not try to teach new musical instruments. He taught Hemapala to play the musical instruments he know on an academic level. Amaratunga taught him to recognize vocal chords, the differences between rhythmic, simple and classical music, and how to use them in society. Hemapala learned music from him for eleven years until 1964.Although Hemapala could not watch the movies, his music teacher Amaratunga took him to watch the movie 'Dulari' and told the story from beginning to end. However, Amaratunga was a little strict and after a while there were various disputes between teacher and Hemapala. So in 1964, Hemapala left the teacher. In the meantime, he received a scholarship to study music further, but he missed that opportunity too. However, he met the famous musician Ananda Perera, through a friend. After recognizing Hemapala's talents, Ananda introduced him to Prof. Ediriweera Sarachchandra. Later, Sarachchandra recorded a band he played and gave it to Neville Jayawardena, the then director of the radio station. With that, Hemapala got the opportunity to go on the radio.On September 28, 1968, at 10.15 pm, the first radio broadcast of Hemapala's flute music was played. In 1969, there was a rating in the academic section of the radio. At that time Hemapala was the only excellent flautist in Sri Lanka. In 1975, a re-ranking was done and he got the same situation as before. At that time he was the only radio player to present classical music on five different instruments. Hemapala also introduced the tradition of playing Hindustani theatrical music on guitar and mandolin to Sri Lanka for the first time. After graduation, he received a half-hour program each month and got the opportunity to participate in music concerts organized by the radio.
In the year 1977, he came to live in Colombo. In the meantime he met Chandrika Siriwardena's husband, Anton Alwis. Upon his introduction, the later president Ranasinghe Premadasa gave him a house on Malwatta Road, Colombo in 1979. At the same time, Hemapala met popular songstress Sujatha Aththanayaka where he involved in her first recordings. Also, when he met Sarath Dassanayake and Stanley Peiris, he became a popular flautist in Sri Lankan music industry. He also did a one-man show called Sangeeth Bhawana. In 1986, C.S. Jayasekara invited him to teach the subject of flutes at the University of the Aesthetics. He worked there for about twenty years. But later he left the teaching due to protests from various people.On 30 June 2016, the musical program Sathsara Ananda featuring Hemapala Perera playing the flute was held on June 30 at 6.30 pm at the Ananda Samarakoon Studio of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC). He is also a lecturer at the University of the Visual and Performing Arts and the University of Sri Jayewardenepura.

== Career ==
He was educated at the University of Minnesota, and the University of Arizona.
Wojahn taught for many years at Indiana University. He has also taught at University of Alabama, University of Arkansas at Little Rock, University of Chicago, University of Houston, and University of New Orleans.  In 2003, he joined Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia. He also teaches at Vermont College of Fine Arts.


== Poetry ==
Most of Wojahn's poetry is metrical although he also works in free verse, usually addressing political and social issues in American life. He often takes as his subjects moments of significance in popular culture, such as the assassination of John Lennon, the professional decline of Jim Morrison or the drowning of Brian Jones. He has said that he hopes his poetry is considered ""activist.""
The poet Richard Hugo selected Wojahn's first book, Icehouse Lights, as a winner of the Yale Series of Younger Poets prize. ""David Wojahn's poems concern themselves with emotive basics: leaving home, watching those we love age and die, the inescapable drone of our mortality,"" Hugo wrote. ""Yet as poems, they are far from usual. They help us welcome inside, again and again, the most personal of feelings.""Wojahn has gone on to publish seven more books of poetry, all with the University of Pittsburgh Press.  Wojahn has also edited a volume of poetry by his late wife, Lynda Hull, entitled The Only World (HarperPerennial, 1995), as well as her more recent Collected Poems (Graywolf, 2006).

Buchan opened in 1952 as a radar centre in the ROTOR radar network. It was soon upgraded with the installation of the powerful AMES Type 80 radar, and became a Master Radar Station, directing most air defence activities directly from its radar displays. During the upgrades to the Linesman/Mediator network it was planned to close, but its location and support for air traffic control kept it operational with its Type 80 through this era.
In 1991, Buchan became one of two locations to host a Control and Reporting Centre (CRC) of the new Improved United Kingdom Air Defence Ground Environment that replaced Linesman. As part of this upgrade, it received an AMES Type 92 radar although it's Type 80 continued operations for some time before finally shutting down in 1993 along with its associated Sperry TPS-34 height finders. The CRC was hosted in a double-storey underground bunker (R3A).
As part of another modernization, the United Kingdom Air Surveillance and Control System (UKASCS) moved all control to RAF Scampton, downgrading former radar sites to unattended operation. For this role it retains its Type 92 in a pressurised radome. Because it is now operated remotely, it is referred to as RRH Buchan, for ""Remote Radar Head"".

For this role it retains its Type 92 in a pressurised radome. Because it is now operated remotely, it is referred to as RRH Buchan, for ""Remote Radar Head"".


== History ==
In 1979 operations moved into interim facilities above ground whilst the 'R3' underground operations block was refitted as an 'R3A', this involved the excavation of one side of the 'R3' and an auxiliary bunker was constructed alongside to provide secure facilities for stand by generators, power cleaning and air filtration. The Buchan Interim Fit (BIF) building housed the GL-161 computer system associated with the TPS-34 radar, both acquired from No 1ACC.
Soviet aircraft transiting between Murmansk in northern Russia and Cuba were routinely intercepted and escorted by live armed fighter aircraft whenever they entered the United Kingdom ""area of interest"".


=== Control and Reporting Centre ===
Following the collapse of the Warsaw Pact in 1991, Buchan became a Control and Reporting Centre (CRC), part of the UK Air Surveillance and Control System (UKASACS). Buchan was responsible for UK airspace north of Newcastle, working closely with counterparts in Scandinavian countries. The southern CRC was located at RAF Neatishead in Norfolk. Around the same time, Buchan became parent station for RAF Saxa Vord in Shetland and RAF Benbecula in the Outer Hebrides, both of which were downgraded to reporting posts which feed data into the UKASACS.Together, the two CRCs processed information which was provided continuously by reporting posts and civilian radars, producing an overview of all aircraft operating within UK airspace, known as the Recognised Air Picture (RAP). Information would also be communicated via digital data-links to neighbouring NATO countries, Airborne Early Warning (AEW) & other aircraft, ground units and ships. Fighter controllers at Buchan also provided tactical control of air-defence aircraft during peacetime Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) interceptions, during training and in the event of war.As part of a major upgrade of RRH sites around the U.K. the MOD began a programme titled HYDRA IN 2020 to install new state of the art communications buildings, radar towers and bespoke perimeter security.


=== Closure and downgrading ===
Throughout the remainder of the station's lifetime, its role was gradually sidelined in favour of the Control Reporting Centre at RAF Neatishead. In May 2000 the Ministry of Defence announced the downgrading of RAF Buchan from a manned station to a remote radar head and that RAF Boulmer in Northumberland and RAF Neatishead in Norfolk, would continue to operate the surveillance and control system. The measure resulted in the loss of 55 civilian jobs and the transfer of over 200 RAF personnel from Buchan. Around 92 military and civilian personnel were expected to remain to operate the remote radar head.Buchan ceased to be a RAF station on 1 September 2004 and the operational part of the station was downgraded and renamed Remote Radar Head Buchan. Manned operations formally ceased at RAF Buchan on 26 November 2004 and the domestic site was officially downsized on 31 March 2005.


=== Post-closure ===
Buchan continues to operate as a Remote Radar Head, inputting radar data to the UK Air Surveillance and Control System (UKASACS).
The separate domestic accommodation site, located in nearby Boddam, was sold by the Ministry of Defence to a private developer. In 2009 the Officers' Mess was converted into the four star Buchan Braes Hotel.
A large part of the domestic site is now home to an Army Cadet Force unit.

His work in these disciplines was to prove important in other fields of mathematics and science, such as differential equations, geometry and physics (especially astrophysics and cosmology).


== Biography ==
Kazimierz Żorawski was born in Szczurzyn near Ciechanów, in the Russian Empire, now in Poland, to Juliusz Bronisław Wiktor Żórawski and Kazimiera Żórawska. In 1884 he completed secondary school in Warsaw.  From 1884 to 1888 he studied mathematics at the University of Warsaw. In 1889 he was selected to continue his mathematics studies on the strength of a paper on observations that he had made at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory.
In the years that followed he studied the theory of conversion groups and analytical mechanics in Leipzig, and differential equations in Göttingen.  In 1891 he was awarded a PhD (under M. Sophius Lie) in Leipzig for his thesis on the applications of group conversion theory to differential geometry.  In 1892 he became a lecturer at the Polytechnic Higher School of Lwów where he taught mathematics and, in 1893, assumed the Chair of Mechanical Science.
In 1893, Żorawski received a doctorate in mathematics from Jagiellonian University in Kraków, and in 1895 he traveled to Berlin to study higher level geodesy.  He later returned to Kraków where, he was named assistant professor and, in 1898, full professor of mathematics at Jagiellonian where he taught higher analysis, geometry (analytic, differential and projective), theory of algebraic curves and theory of singularities. In 1900 he was elected a member of the Academy of Learning (from 1919 Polish Academy of Learning) in Kraków.
In 1905, Żorawski became a Dean of the Faculty of philosophy at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków, and in 1910, he became an associate member of the Czech Academy of Sciences in Prague.  In 1911, he became a president of the Societies of the Scientific Committee. Two years later he took part in the Organizational Committee of  Academy of Maining in Kraków.  From 1917 to 1918, he was a rector  and from 1918 to 1919 vice-rector of the Jagiellonian University
In 1919, Żorawski settled in Warsaw where he became a full professor in mathematics at the Warsaw University of Technology, while at the same time teaching courses on the application of geometric analysis at the University of Warsaw.  That same year he became a member of the Polish Society of Mathematics.

In 1920, Żorawski was elected to the Warsaw Society of Science and Letters, and from 1926 to 1931, served as its President.  To honor his services, the Society struck a commemorative medal (see picture) in 1931.  At the same time, he became an active member of the Warsaw Technical Academy of Science, and in 1926, a full professor of mathematics at the University of Warsaw. He was a Polish delegate for the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation which was formally established in January 1922  (Marie Curie was a prominent member of this organization).
Żorawski announced his retirement in 1935 after 46 years devoted to professorship.  Upon his retirement, the University of Warsaw conferred upon him the title of Professor Emeritus in mathematics and natural science.
Both before World War II and during the Nazi occupation of Poland, Professor Żorawski worked on analytical geometry, primarily in the area of first- and second-degree plane figures and differential properties of real andicomplex plane figures.  His work was three-quarters completed when the Warsaw Uprising occurred.  Żorawski, like tens of thousands of Warsaw residents, was expelled from the capital and sent to Pruszków.  His apartment, which contained all of his property, including many of his scientific papers, was destroyed by fire.
Upon his release from the camp of Pruszków along with a group of other scientists, Zorawski took refuge in Nieborów, staying at the home of the Radziwill family.  After the Red Army occupied Poland, Żorawski returned to a destroyed Warsaw and lived for a time with his daughter Leokadia Paprocka.  Shortly thereafter, the Ministry for Education gave him a small bedroom with a kitchen at the Students House at the Narutowicz Square in Warsaw, one of the few buildings not destroyed by the Germans during the war. There he rewrote the nearly two-thirds (2650 pages) of his work that had been destroyed during the Warsaw Uprising.
In 1952, Żorawski was named a full member of the Polish Academy of Sciences.  He was also decorated with the Commander's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta and the Gold Cross of Merit.
Żorawski died in 1953.
After his death, the importance of his work to the development of Polish mathematics was recognized by many scientists.  A telegram addressed to his family by Bronisław Knaster, Edward Marczewski, Hugo Steinhaus, and Władysław Ślebodziński expressed this recognition: ""[W]e wish to express to the family of Professor Kazimierz Żorawski our deep compassion.  He was the first of the scientists of his generation to bring the name of Poland to the forefront of world mathematics.""


== Accomplishments ==
Kazimierz Żorawski dealt with a particularly difficult field of mathematics – continuous invariants of Lie groups, and the results of his work have been applied to other fields of mathematics and science, especially differential equations, geometry and physics.
The seventy scientific works of Professor Żorawski relate mainly to analytical geometry, differential geometry, Lie groups, differential equations, kinematics of continuous symmetry, and non-Euclidean complex geometry.


=== Kraków School of Mathematics ===
At the turn of the 20th century, groups of mathematicians worked in the Polish scientific centers of Lwów, Kraków and Warsaw and created the ""mathematical Schools"" of Warsaw, Lwów and Kraków.  Kazimierz Żorawski, along with Stanisław Zaremba, (both faculty members of Jagiellonian University) was a cofounder of the Kraków School of Mathematics, to which professors Franciszek Leja, Władysław Ślebodziński and Tadeusz Ważewski also belonged.  Thus, Jagiellonian became the center of traditional analysis of differential equations and analytical functions.


=== Polish Mathematical Society ===
On April 2, 1919, Żorawski chaired the inaugural meeting, in Kraków, of the Mathematical Society, which soon changed its name to the Polish Mathematical Society.  Żorawski is considered one of the key founders of this Society.

In 1958, Polish Mathematical Society member Władysław Ślebodziński recalled the importance of the role played by Stanisław Zaremba and Kazimierz Żorawski in the development of Polish mathematics:

...  One can say that, thanks to these two scientists, Polish mathematics ceased being a mere consumer of foreign thinking and analysis.  Both played pivotal roles in the development of this science.  Under the political conditions of the time, Stanislaw Zaremba and Kazimierz Żorawski were, for fifteen years, the only representatives of cutting-edge Polish mathematics (...) judging these facts by contrasting them with the current state of affairs, shows their immense progress and accomplishments (...) in spite of the catastrophic effects on Polish mathematics caused by the Nazi occupation.


=== Lie groups ===
Żorawski was a student of eminent Norwegian professor Sophus Lie, the author of the theory of continuous groups (Lie groups).  Żorawski developed several areas close to the theory of Lie groups and other theories which were based upon it—in particular the theories of differential equations and differential geometry, as well as topics from the theory of integral invariants (new at that time), and selected problems of kinematics.
While a professor in Leipzig, Lie wrote the following regarding Żorawski‘s work devoted to Lie groups:  

Among the work done in Leipzig, let us remember in particular the superb work of Zorawski on the invariants of flexibility.  With much ability, Żorawski worked to resolve difficult and complicated calculations which were necessary to solve the problems...


== Personal life ==
In 1863, Żorawski's mother, Kazimiera, took part in the January Uprising against the Russian Empire. This uprising started as a spontaneous protest by young Poles against conscription into the Russian Army and was soon joined by various politicians and high ranking Polish officers from the tsarist army.  While the uprising failed militarily, it did succeed in blunting the effect of the Tsar's abolition of serfdom in the Russian partition. Kazimiera was captured and imprisoned by the Russian authorities, and her father was imprisoned in the citadel at Warsaw, where he later died.
Żorawski had five siblings, one of whom, Stanislaw, became proprietor of the Obrebiec Estate, near Przasnysz. In 1940, his property was seized by the Nazis and Stanislaw was arrested and interned at the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp, where he died.
Żorawski fell in with love with the family governess, Maria Skłodowska (later better known as Marie Curie), whose father was a relative of the Żorawskis. The two discussed marriage, but Żorawski’s parents rejected Maria due to her family's poverty. Nevertheless, their hopes of marriage continued until 1891, when a dispirited Maria moved to Warsaw and then to Paris, where she eventually married Pierre Curie and earned two Nobel prizes.
Żorawski married Leokadia Jewniewicz, a well-known pianist. Her father, Hipolit, was a professor at the Institute of Technology in St. Petersburg, specializing in applied mathematics. One of his works, ""The Theory of Elasticity"", was published posthumously in Warsaw in 1910.
Żorawski and his wife had three children: Juliusz, Leokadia, and Maria. Juliusz became a well-known architect, often compared with Le Corbusier; after World War II he was a professor of architecture at the Kraków Polytechnic.

== History ==


=== World War I ===
No. XIII Squadron RFC was formed at RAF Gosport, Hampshire on 10 January 1915 and moved to France and the Western Front on 19 October 1915, initially on Army co-operation duties and subsequently on bombing raids, pioneering formation bombing. Aircraft types operated during the war included the Martinsyde G.100, the Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2, the Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8, the SPAD VII and SPAD XIII, and the Sopwith Dolphin fighters. The squadron disbanded on 31 December 1919.


=== World War II ===
The unit had reformed at RAF Kenley on 1 April 1924 and inter-war years saw the squadron operate from various UK bases equipped with a variety of aircraft types including the Bristol F.2, Armstrong Whitworth Atlas, Hawker Audax and Hawker Hector for army cooperation. By January 1939 the squadron was equipped with Westland Lysanders and moved to France on 2 October until late May 1940 when it withdrew to UK bases following the Fall of France.In May 1941 No. XIII Squadron changed role and theatre, flying a variety of bomber aircraft including the Bristol Blenheim and Douglas Boston light bombers in the Mediterranean until the end of the war, disbanding on 19 April 1946.


=== Cold War (1946–1982) ===

No. XIII Squadron reformed as No. 13 (Photographic Reconnaissance) Squadron on 1 September 1946 at RAF Ein Shemer, Palestine, when No. 680 Squadron was renumbered. Peace heralded the return to reconnaissance duties, with the unit flying the de Havilland Mosquito PR.34. Moving to Egypt, the squadron converted to the Gloster Meteor PR.10 in 1952 and by 1956 was operating the English Electric Canberra PR.7.During the 1956 Suez Crisis, the squadron flew reconnaissance flights over Syria from Cyprus, which resulted in one Canberra being shot down by the Syrian Air Force.In 1978, the squadron moved to RAF Wyton near Huntingdon in the UK, flying Canberra PR.7 and PR.9s, built by Short Brothers, until the unit disbanded on 1 January 1982.


=== Panavia Tornado (1990–2011) ===


==== RAF Honington & Gulf War (1990–1994) ====
The squadron reformed at RAF Honington on 1 January 1990 equipped with reconnaissance Tornado GR.1A aircraft. These aircraft were equipped with the new and somewhat embryonic reconnaissance equipment designed to exploit the night, all-weather capability of the Tornado by using a unique system of infra-red sensors and video recorders. The complete system is carried and allows the Navigator to either view the imagery in real time or later in the mission. As the Allied Coalition began to deploy forces to the Gulf in the latter part of 1990, it quickly became apparent that the unique night reconnaissance capability of the Tornado GR.1A could provide vital intelligence to the Allied commanders. As a result, on 15/16 January 1991, immediately before hostilities commenced, 6 aircraft were deployed to Saudi Arabia. During the first nights of the War, the Reconnaissance Wing successfully discovered several of the elusive Scud sites.The majority of sorties were however, tasked into Central and Eastern Iraq to identify the disposition of the various Iraqi ground forces in preparation for the ground offensive. Although the rest of the Coalition Air Forces moved to medium level operations after the first few nights of the air war, the GR.1As operated at night and at low-level for the duration of the conflict. The Squadron was also fundamental to the success of the Tornado/TIALD (Thermal Imaging And Laser Designation) combination. 4 XIII Squadron crews began the work-up from mid-January and, after encouraging results, four aircraft flew to Tabuk.After the war, the Squadron continued its peacetime training role at RAF Honington as well as taking part in Operation Jural, the monitoring of a No-Fly Zone in the South of Iraq below the 32nd parallel north.


==== RAF Marham (1994–2011) ====

On 1 February 1994, No. XIII Squadron moved to RAF Marham. Since that time, the Squadron has taken part in a number of successful exercises around the world from Yuma in America to Penang, Malaysia. Deployments to operational theatres have continued to be a major feature of the squadron's life having deployed on Operation Warden and Operation Bolton to monitor both the Northern and Southern No-Fly Zones in Iraq. XIII Squadron crews joined the Ali Al Salem Combat Air Wing (Composite RAF Squadron formed from the Tornado GR4 Force for Gulf War 2) in early 2003 and flew Scud Hunting missions in the Western Desert of Iraq during the Iraq War of 2003. The squadron also flew the last sortie by a Tornado in support of Operation Telic in 2009.In the summer of 2010 the squadron flew Close Air Support in Afghanistan as part of Operation Herrick, and in 2011 they fired Storm Shadow missiles against Libya in the early days of Operation Ellamy.  A few weeks later, on 13 May 2011, the squadron was disbanded as part of the reductions announced in the Strategic Defence and Security Review of 2010.


=== MQ-9 Reaper (2012–present) ===
At the disbandment parade of XIII (Tornado) Squadron in May 2011, the Chief of the Air Staff announced the formation of a second unit operating the MQ-9 Reaper RPAS, which would receive the XIII Squadron numberplate. XIII (Reaper) Squadron was reformed on 26 October 2012 at RAF Waddington. Subsequently, the Squadron flew the first remote operational mission from UK soil towards the end of April 2013 and conducted its first remote weapons strike a few days later.The squadron will re-equip with Protector RG Mk1 when that comes into service around 2024.

Magill left the show in January 1991, but reprised the role for several brief appearances until July 1995.


== Development ==
Amos is one of Emmerdale's original characters conceived by creator Kevin Laffan. He was known for his bushy sideburns, which were the result of Magill having rushed to the audition from playing an Edwardian character in a stage play. He thought he would be asked to shave the sideburns if he secured the part, but the producer told him they were ideal for the part and to keep them. At the beginning of the serial, Amos is the landlord of The Woolpack pub. Anthony Hayward described him as having a ""dour manner and pernickety ways."" Magill saw himself in his character, although he admitted that he was more of ""a city slicker"". He also said Amos was the village gossip and a loner. This changed with the introduction of Henry Wilks (Arthur Pentelow), who formed a comic double act with Amos for 19 years. Magill explained: 

""I saw him as a man who found it difficult to make friends, yet, once he was behind the bar and lord of all he surveyed, he was able to relate to people. But he had the bar between them, of course. Originally, Henry Wilks had nothing to do with the pub, but Kevin Laffan, the creator, spotted a rapport between me and Arthur Pentelow and came up with the idea of moving Henry into the Woolpack. Henry was originally to have been the villain of the piece and Amos was to find a wife and get married. Arthur and I had so much in common. We both loved doing The Times crossword every day – which is a great bond – both smoked a pipe and both liked good food and a bottle of wine.""The introduction of Henry also led to Amos's signature catchphrase ""Nay, Mr Wilks"". As Amos was tied to The Woolpack, Magill did not do any on-location filming and rarely went outside of the pub set. Laffan eventually gave the character some new hobbies which often took him outside, including gardening and a job as a journalist for the Hotten Courier newspaper. Amos was a bachelor, with Hayward noting ""women always seemed a bit of a mystery to the long-time single landlord"", but he once proposed to Alison Gibbons (Carolyn Moody) and Annie Sugden (Sheila Mercier) in the same year. Magill left the show in January 1991, saying ""I didn't want to pass my Emmerdale sell-by date"". His sideburns were shaved off during an appearance on Wogan. On-screen, Amos leaves the village for Spain following a stroke. A reporter for The Daily Telegraph noted that Amos had become one of the longest-serving fictional publicans on British television. Magill later reprised the role for brief appearance. Amos and Annie eventually marry 20 years after his first proposal in 1995. Magill made his final appearance in July 1995.


== Storylines ==
With his position in The Woolpack pub, Amos was Beckindale's local gossip and was at the centre of all the local news. Amos becomes convinced that the brewery prefers couples to run pubs and proposes to widow Annie Sugden. Annie turns him down gently. Amos goes into business with Henry Wilks and they run the pub together. The Woolpack premises is moved when it is found to be suffering from subsidence. A couple of years later, while closing up, Amos and Mr Wilks are threatened by burglars and are locked in the cellar all night. Amos gives his barmaid Dolly Acaster (Katharine Barker) away when she marries Matt Skilbeck (Frederick Pyne). Gamekeeper Seth Armstrong (Stan Richards) switches from The Malt Shovel to The Woolpack and Seth continuously irritates Amos. Amos gains an allotment and shares a rivalry with Seth for many years. 
Amos's aunt Emily Brearly (Ann Way) turns up for a visit and Amos is terrified of her. She flees the Woolpack on discovering that Amos has written-up a report on UFOs spotted locally, stating that he is tampering with unknown forces. A couple of years later, she returns to announce that Amos's uncle Arthur has died. Amos sets up his own shot-lived village newsletter – The Beckindale Bugle. Amos befriends NY Estates boss Alan Turner (Richard Thorp). He is distressed to hear Alan criticising him to a golfing pal. From then on, Amos treats Alan frostily, insisting on calling him ""Mr Turner"". Amos's brother Ezra Brearly (Martin Matthews) makes a few visits to his brother. Amos's rivalry with Ernie Shuttleworth (John Comer) of the Malt Shovel public house takes on a new intensity, as they try to outdo the other with various ventures, including happy hours, juke boxes and dominoes tournaments. Ernie is thrilled to get Amos a ticking off from the local police by tampering with the Woolpack clock so the pub is caught serving drinks after hours. Amos almost marries Gloria Pinfold (Hope Johnston), an old sweetheart of his from many years before. She is a strong-willed woman who moves into the Woolpack and interferes with Henry's book keeping and the diet of the two men, insisting that full English breakfasts are not to be eaten because of high cholesterol and fat content. Gloria leaves Amos for another man. Amos discovers a crop circle at Home Farm and is convinced that aliens have landed in Beckindale. By the time Amos takes a local expert to see the spectacle, the field has been harvested.
While celebrating Annie's 70th birthday, Amos suffers a stroke. He decides to retire and hands the pub over to Alan Turner. Amos returns to the village for Henry's funeral, before moving to Spain. He makes further returns for various events, including Annie's wedding to Leonard Kempinski (Bernard Archard), the funeral of the plane crash victims, Alan's wedding to Shirley Foster (Rachel Davies), and Jack Sugden (Clive Hornby) and Sarah Connelly's (Madeleine Howard) wedding, where he announces that the residents of Beckindale have decided to rename the village Emmerdale in honour of Annie. He later returns for the first anniversary of the plane crash. Amos accompanies Annie home for her son Joe Sugden's (Frazer Hines) funeral. Amos remarks that one night while enjoying a drink with Joe in Spain, Joe had asked Amos to make sure that if anything was to happen to him that there would be a few free drinks given in The Woolpack after the funeral. Amos thought that this request was strange considering that Joe was more likely to outlive him, hinting that Joe's death may not have been an accident. Following the funeral, Annie proposes to Amos, who tells her that he will have to think about it. Annie, feeling embarrassed, tells him to forget about it. After Amos discusses it with Alan, he proposes to Annie and she accepts. Sarah then waves them off as they leave Emmerdale Farm, returning to their home in Spain, where he and Annie marry.


== Reception ==
A Daily Telegraph writer said Magill's ""grumpy pub landlord"" was one of the best-loved characters in Emmerdale, who ruled The Woolpack with ""a benign Yorkshire gruffness."" Of Magill's performance, they wrote ""While easily caricatured, Magill's portrayal of Amos was remarkably subtle, containing elements of real sadness and pathos.""

== Plot ==
Homer unsuccessfully tries to win tickets for a football game on a radio contest. Ned wins the tickets and invites Homer as his guest. Although he dislikes Ned, Homer accepts because he desperately wants to attend the game. Ned pays for all of the food and persuades the winning quarterback to give the game ball to Homer. Overwhelmed by Ned's generosity, Homer becomes friends with Ned and his family.
Homer begins acting overly grateful and annoys Ned and his family to no end by interrupting their family time together. The Flanders family and the Simpson family go on a camping trip together but do not get along. When the Simpsons start a food fight, Ned tells his wife that he has grown to hate Homer.
Upon returning home, Homer remains oblivious to Ned's animosity. He arrives at the Flanders' house expecting to play golf, but Ned and his family get in their car and race off without him. Pulled over by Chief Wiggum for speeding, Ned takes a sobriety test as disapproving townspeople watch. At church, when the entire congregation bow their heads in prayer, Homer inhales very loudly through his nose, causing Ned to yell at him. This alarms the worshippers, who become even more upset with Ned. But Homer sticks up for Ned and convinces them to give him another chance.
The next week, everything returns to normal as Homer is once again annoyed by Ned. The episode ends with the Simpsons spending the night in Homer's great Uncle Boris' haunted house, which he recently inherited. After turning out the lights, they see something that causes them to scream in terror.


== Production ==
""Homer Loves Flanders"" was the last episode to be pitched by Conan O'Brien before he left The Simpsons. David Richardson was assigned to write it, and Wes Archer to direct it. Richardson wrote the episode at a Motel 6 in Hemet, California while he was dating an actress who was shooting a film there. In this season, the staff wanted to take a deeper look at the relationships of the characters. One of the things they wanted to explore in particular was what Homer and Flanders have in common and how they could turn into friends. Former show runner David Mirkin enjoyed making Homer and Flanders get along because they do not normally act that way.The episode begins with the Simpson family watching a news broadcast in which the news anchor Kent Brockman calls the United States Army a ""kill-bot factory"". Mirkin said this was a joke the staff ""particularly loved to do"" because it pointed out how negative and mean-spirited news broadcasts can be, and how they are seemingly ""always trying to scare everybody"" by creating panic and depression. In one scene in the episode, Marge begins hallucinating after drinking from Springfield's water supply, which has been spiked with LSD by Springfield's rival town, Shelbyville. The Fox network's censors wanted the scene to be cut from the episode because they did not like the idea of Marge ""getting high"" on LSD. Mirkin defended the scene, and argued Marge was not ""doing it on purpose"", so the censors ultimately allowed the scene to remain in the episode. The censors also hated Ned's response to his wife telling him to drive his car faster (""I can't! It's a Geo!"") fearing they could lose the car company's sponsorship, but Mirkin kept the line in. In another scene, Homer becomes frustrated at God for not getting the tickets to the game, so yells at a waffle stuck to the ceiling that he believes is God. Marge points out that it is just a waffle that Bart threw up there. This scene, inspired by some melted caramel stuck to the ceiling of the Simpsons writers' room, is one of Mirkin's and Richardson's ""all time favorite"" jokes.


== Cultural references ==

When Homer hears the 1978 song ""Two Tickets to Paradise"" by Eddie Money on the radio, he sings along and plays air guitar. As Homer is eating nachos at the football game, he makes up a song called ""Nacho Man"", a reference to Village People's 1978 song ""Macho Man"". Homer's ""Rappin' Ronnie Reagan"" cassette is a reference to the 1984 Broadway show and novelty music video Rap Master Ronnie and Ronald Reagan. When Flanders is mistakenly arrested for taking drugs, Chief Wiggum asks him ""Where's your Messiah now?"", a line commonly mistakenly believed to be spoken by Edward G. Robinson's character Dathan in the 1956 film The Ten Commandments but in fact originates from Billy Crystal's stand-up impersonation of Robinson. Ned's dream involves him shooting at people inside the university clock tower based on the 1975 film The Deadly Tower, itself based on Charles Whitman's 1966 killing spree. The scene where Homer chases Flanders's car is a parallel of the sequence in Terminator 2: Judgment Day, in which Robert Patrick's character T-1000 chases the heroes in the police car after escaping from the hospital. Homer morphing through the Flanders hedge also parodies how the T-1000's shape shifting abilities were shown in the film. It has since become a popular internet meme. When Rod and Todd are watching television in the Flanders's living room, a picture of Leonardo da Vinci's painting The Last Supper can be seen behind them. The homeless shelter that Homer and Flanders visit is called Helter Shelter, a reference to the 1968 song ""Helter Skelter"" by The Beatles. Helter Shelter would later go on to be used as title of an episode in the shows fourteenth season.

=== Critical reception ===
Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics.
In 2007, Patrick Enright of Today called the episode his eighth favorite of the show. He praised the references to Terminator 2 in the episode, as well as Lisa's self-referential quote about how, ""by next week, we'll be back to where we started from, ready for another wacky adventure.""The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought the episode had ""some great existential musings"" from Lisa. They added that it also ""contains some nice moments highlighting the differences between the Simpsons and the Flanders.""DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said: ""I always remembered [""Homer Loves Flanders""] to be a great episode – and I recalled correctly. Sure, the show goes with a less than creative presence; it’s an easy story to make characters behave in atypical ways. However, the development of the theme is terrific, as we learn the friendship of Homer Simpson is worse than the antagonism of Homer Simpson."" DVD Talk gave the episode a 4 out of 5 score.Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B− grade, claiming the ""rather large dose of sentimentality"" and ""fewer moments of absurdity"" in the episode gave it ""the feeling that it belongs in one of the series' earlier seasons"".The Orlando Sentinel's Gregory Hardy named it the second best episode of the show with a sports theme.A moment in the episode where Homer backs into Ned's hedges became an internet meme in the 2010s. The scene was later referenced in the season 30 episode, ""The Girl on the Bus"" where Homer texts Lisa a GIF of himself going into the hedge. The scene was later referenced again in the season 32 episode, ""Wad Goals"", where Bart tells his friends ""I’ve seen my dad do this"" immediately before showing them how to back into a hedge.


=== Ratings ===
In its original American broadcast, ""Homer Loves Flanders"" finished 43rd in the ratings for the week of March 14–20, 1994, with a Nielsen rating of 10.9. The episode was the third highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following Beverly Hills, 90210 and Melrose Place.
